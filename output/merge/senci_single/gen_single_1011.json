{"1011": "we propose a human-in-the-loop ( huml) dictionary expansion approach that employs a lightweight neural language model coupled with tight huml supervision to assist the user in building and maintaining a domain-specific dictionary from an input text corpus. the approach is based on the explore/exploit paradigm to effectively discover new instances ( explore) from the text corpus as well as predict new unseen terms not currently in the corpus using the accepted dictionary entries ( exploit). given an input text corpus and a set of seed examples, the proposed approach runs in two phases, explore and exploit, to identify new potential dictionary entries. the exploit phase tries to identify similar instances to the dictionary entries that are present in the input text corpus, while both cases may simply not occur. however, these phrases are likely to occur in future texts from the same source, and thus are important to include in any entity extraction. multiterm phrases are a challenge for word2 style systems as they need to be known prior to model creation. in this work, we adopt the glimpse computer/ human part- psb2016 is a recent benchmarking initiative on the problem url/ sharedtaskeval.html. experiments show that the system is more effective when receiving huml feedback after identified candidates, compared to receiving huml feedback after identified candidates, while both cases require equal amount of human effort. while completely automatic techniques are highly appealing they need to be fine-tuned for every new task. we propose a human-in-the-loop approach where the tuning is an integral part of the process, i.e. the human works in partnership with the statistical method to drive the semantic of the task effectively and efficaciously. for a surveillance application (e.g., drug side effects mentioned on twitter) it reduces how frequently a human needs to tune up the lexicon to make sure it is catching all relevant entity instances. for the experiments we use data from the healtcare domain, specifically tackling the problem of identifying adverse drug reactions in user generated data. as an input set of seed examples we compare the performance of the explore, exploit and the explore/exploit approaches for discovering new dictionary instances. this paper proposes an interactive dictionary expansion tool using a lightweight neural language model. it incorporates human feedback to improve performance and control semantic drift at every iteration cycle. the approach is based on the explore/exploit paradigm to effectively discover new instances ( explore) from the text corpus as well as predict new unseen terms not currently in the corpus using the accepted dictionary entries ( exploit) this paper proposes an interactive dictionary expansion tool using a lightweight neural language model. our algorithm is iterative and purely statistical, hence does not require any feature extraction beyond tokenization. the experiments showed high importance of tight huml integration on discovery efficiency.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1002": "###", "1003": "###", "1004": "###", "1005": "###", "1006": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###", "1009": "###", "1010": "###", "1012": "###", "1013": "###", "1014": "###", "1015": "###", "1016": "###", "1017": "###", "1018": "###", "1019": "###", "1020": "###", "1021": "###"}
