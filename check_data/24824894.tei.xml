<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Digital traces of human activity have exposed social behavior to web and data mining algorithms. Researchers have analyzed the growing social data to understand, among other things, how information spreads in social networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and the factors a ecting user engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in online platforms. Yet social data analysis presents multi-faceted challenges that existing data mining approaches are not well-equipped to handle. Real-world data is noisy and sparse. To uncover hidden pa erns, scientists aggregate data over the population, which tends to improve statistics and signal-to-noise ratio. However, real-world data is also heterogeneous, i.e., composed of subgroups that vary widely in size and behavior. is heterogeneity can severely bias analysis of social data.</p><p>One example of such bias is Simpson's paradox. According to the paradox, an association observed in data that has been aggregated over an entire population may be quite di erent from, and even opposite to, those of the underlying subgroups. Failure to take this e ect into account can distort conclusions drawn from data. One of the be er known examples of Simpson's paradox comes from a study of gender bias in graduate admissions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In the aggregate admissions data there appears to be a statistically signi cant bias against women: a smaller fraction of female applicants is admi ed for graduate studies. However, when admissions data is disaggregated by department, women have parity and even a slight advantage over men in some departments. e paradox arises because departments preferred by female applicants have lower admissions rates for both genders.</p><p>Simpson's paradox also a ects analysis of trends. When measuring how an outcome changes as a function of an independent variable, the characteristics of the population over which the trend is measured may change as a function of the independent variable due to survivor bias. As a result, the data may appear to exhibit a trend, which disappears or reverses when the data is disaggregated. For example, it may appear that repeated exposures to information or hashtags on social media make an individual less likely to share it with his or her followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In fact, the opposite is true: the more people are exposed to information, the more likely they are to share it with followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, those who follow many others (and are likely to be exposed to a meme or a hashtag multiple times) are less responsive overall, due to the high volume of information they receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. eir reduced susceptibility to exposures biases the aggregate response, leading to wrong conclusions about behavior. Once disaggregated based on the volume of information received, a clearer pa ern of exposure response emerges, one that is more predictive of the actual response <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. However, despite accumulating evidence that Simpson's paradox a ects inference of trends in social and behavioral data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, researchers do not routinely test for it in their studies.</p><p>We describe a method to identify Simpson's paradoxes in the analysis of trends in social data. Our statistical approach nds pairs of variables-that we call Simpson's pairs-such that a trend in some outcome as a function of the rst independent variable observed in the aggregate data disappears or reverses itself when the data is disaggregated into distinct subgroups on the second conditioning variable. We perform mathematical analysis, which identi es two necessary conditions for the paradox to occur: (1) the independent and conditioning variables are correlated and (2) the value of the outcome variable di ers within conditioning subgroups.</p><p>We apply the proposed approach to data collected from Stack Exchange, a popular question-answering platform. Speci cally, we analyze factors a ecting answerer performance, measured as the likelihood the answer provided by the answerer will be accepted by the asker as the best answer to his or her question. We construct a variety of features to describe answers and answerers, and study how the outcome-in this case answer acceptance-depends on these features. We compare results of statistical trends found in aggregated and disaggregated data to identify Simpsons's pairs. Our analysis discovers several cases of Simpson's paradox in Stack Exchange data. In addition to a known e ect that describes deterioration of answerer performance over the course of a session, our method identi es several new cases of Simpson's paradox. ese paradoxes yield new insights into answerer performance on Stack Exchange. For example, creating a new feature to describe answerers, which combines variables of a Simpson's pair, leads to a more robust proxy of answerer performance.</p><p>Presence of a Simpson's paradox in social data can indicate interesting pa erns <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, including important behavioral di erences. e paradox suggests that subgroups within the population under study systematically di er in their behavior, and these di erences are large enough to a ect aggregate trends. In such cases the trends discovered in disaggregated data are more likely to describe-and predict-individual behavior than the trends found in aggregated data. us, to build more robust models of behavior, data scientists need to identify the subgroups within their data or risk drawing wrong conclusions. e method presented in this paper provides a simple framework for identifying such interesting subgroups by systematically searching for Simpson's paradox in trend data. e rest of the paper is organized as follows. First, we present background, including multiple observations of Simpson's paradox in a variety of disciplies (Sec. 2). en we describe our methodology for detecting Simpson's paradox by identifying covariates in data, and analyze the paradox mathematically to gain more insight into its origins (Sec. 3). Finally, we apply our method to real-world data from the question-answering site Stack Exchange, and demonstrate its ability to automatically identify novel cases of Simpson's paradox (Sec. 4). We conclude with the discussion of implications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK</head><p>e goal of data analysis is to identify important associations between features, or variables, in data. However, hidden correlations between variables can lead analysis to wrong conclusions. One important manifestation of this e ect is Simpson's paradox, according to which an association that appears in di erent subgroups of data may disappear, and even reverse itself, when data is aggregated across subgroups. Instances of the paradox have been documented across a variety of disciplines, including demographics, economics, political science, and clinical research, and it has been argued that the presence of Simpson's paradox implies that interesting pa erns exist in data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. A notorious example of Simpson's paradox arose during a gender bias lawsuit against UC Berkeley. Analysis of graduate school admissions data revealed a statistically signi cant bias against women. However, the pa ern of discrimination observed in this aggregate data disappeared when admissions data was disaggregated by department. Bickel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> a ributed this e ect to Simpson's paradox. ey argued that the subtle correlations between the popularity of departments among the genders and their selectivity resulted in women applying to departments that were hardest to get into, which skewed analysis.</p><p>Simpson's paradox must also be considered in the analysis of trends. Vaupel and Yashin <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> give a compelling illustration of how survivor bias can shi the composition of data, distorting the conclusions drawn from it. Analysis of recidivism among convicts released from prison shows that the rate at which they return to prison declines over time. From this, policy makers may conclude that age has a pacifying e ect on crime: older convicts are less likely to commit crimes. In reality, this conclusion is false. Instead, we can think of the population of ex-convicts as composed of two subgroups with constant, but very di erent recidivism rates. e rst subgroup, let's call them "reformed, " will never commit a crime once released from prison. e other subgroup, the "incorrigibles, " will always commit a crime. Over time, as "incorrigibles" commit o enses and return to prison, there are fewer of them le in the population. e survivor bias changes the composition of the population under study, creating an illusion of an overall decline in recidivism rates. As Vaupel and Yashin warn, "unsuspecting researchers who are not wary of heterogeneity's ruses may fallaciously assume that observed pa erns for the population as a whole also hold on the sub-population or individual level." eir paper gives numerous other examples of such ecological fallacies.</p><p>Similar illusions crop up in many studies of social behavior. For example, when examining how social media users respond to information from their friends (other users that they follow), it may appear that if more of a user's friends use a hashtag then the user will be less likely to use it himself or herself <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Similarly, the more friends share some information, the less likely the user is to share it with his or her followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. From this, one may conclude the additional exposures to information in a sense "innoculate" the user and act to suppress the sharing of information. In fact, this is not the case, and instead, additional exposures monotonically increase the user's likelihood to share information with followers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. However, those users who follow many others, and are likely to be exposed to information or a hashtag multiple times, are less responsive overall, because they are overloaded with information they receive from all the friends they follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Calculating response as a function of the number of exposures in the aggregate data falls prey to survivor bias: the more responsive users (with fewer friends) quickly drop out of the average (since they are generally exposed fewer times), leaving the highly connected, but less responsive, users behind. e reduced susceptibility of these highly connected users biases aggregate response, leading to wrong conclusions about individual behavior. Once data is disaggregated based on the volume of information individuals receive, a clearer pa ern of response emerges, one that is more predictive of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Multiple examples of Simpson's paradox have been identi ed in empirical studies of online behavior. A study <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> of Reddit found that while it may appear that average comment length on decreases over any xed period of time, when data is disaggregated into groups based on the year user joined Reddit, comment length within each group increases during the same time period. It is only because users who joined early tend to write longer comments that the Simpson's paradox appears.</p><p>Data heterogeneity also impacts statistical analysis of data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and causal inference <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. However, no general framework to recognize and mitigate Simpson's paradox exist. Current methods require that the structure of data be explicitly speci ed <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or at best be guided by subject ma er knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Despite accumulating evidence that Simpson's paradox a ects inference from data <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, scientists do not routinely test for the presence of this paradox in heterogeneous data. Our work addresses this knowledge gap by proposing a statistical method to systematically uncover instances of Simpson's paradox in data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODS</head><p>We propose a method to systematically uncover Simpson's paradox for trends in data. We denote as Y the dependent variable in the data set, i.e., an outcome being measured, and as X = {X 1 , X 2 , . . . , X m } the set of m independent variables or features. e goal of the method is to identify pairs of variables (X p , X c )-Simpson's pairssuch that a trend in Y as a function of X p disappears or reverses when the data is disaggregated by conditioning on X c . More specifically, our method searches for pairs of variables</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(X p , X c ) such that d dx p E[Y |X p = x p ] &gt; 0 ∀x p ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">d dx p E[Y |X p = x p , X c = x c ] ≤ 0 ∀x p , x c .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>and vice versa (i.e., dE</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[Y |X p = x p ]/dx p &lt; 0, dE[Y |X p = x p , X c = x c ]/dx p ≥ 0)</formula><p>. Equations (1) and (2) hold if the expected value of Y is a monotonically increasing (or decreasing) function of X p alone, but conditioned on X c is a monotonically decreasing (resp. increasing) function of X p , or is constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Finding Simpson's Pairs</head><p>With this goal in mind, we employ linear models to quantify the relationship between Y , an independent variable X p , and a conditioning variable X c upon which the data is disaggregated. Firstly, on the aggregate level, we model the relationship between Y and X p as a linear model of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">E[Y |X p = x p ] = f p (α + βx p ),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">f p (α + βx p )</formula><p>is a monotonically increasing function of its argument α + βx p . e parameter α in Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>is the intercept of the regression function, while the trend parameter β quanti es the e ect of X p on Y . Secondly, for the disaggregation, we t linear models of the form of Eq. (3) but with di erent values of the parameters α and β depending on the value of X c :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E[Y |X p = x p , X c = x c ] = f p,c (α(x c ) + β(x c )x p ),<label>(4)</label></formula><p>When ing linear models f (α + βX ) we have not only a ed trend parameter β but also a p-value which gives the probability of nding an intercept β at least as extreme as the ed value under the null hypothesis H 0 : β = 0. From this, we have three possibilities:</p><p>• β is not statistically di erent from zero (sgn(β) = 0), • β is statistically di erent from zero and positive (sgn(β) = 1), • β is statistically di erent from zero and negative (sgn(β) = -1). is mechanism allows us to test for Simpson's paradox by comparing the sign of β from the aggregated t (Eq. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>) with the signs of the β's from the disaggregated ts (Eq. (4)). Although Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">3</ref>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref> state that the signs from the disaggregated curves should all be di erent from the aggregated curve, in practice this is too strict, especially as human behavioral data is noisy. us, we compare the sign of the t to aggregated data to the simple average of the signs of ts to disaggregated data-if the signs are di erent then we have uncovered an instance of Simpson's paradox. e summary of the algorithm is the following: Data Disaggregation. A critical step in our method is disaggregating data by conditioning on variable X c . e idea behind disaggregation is to segment data into more homogeneous subgroups of similar elements. For multinomial variables X c , disaggregation step simply involves grouping data by unique values of X c . However, for continuous X c or discrete variables with large range, this step is more complex. We can bin the elements according to their values of X c , but the decision has to be made how large each bin is, whether bin sizes scale linearly or logarithmically, etc. If the bin is too small, it may not contain enough samples for a statistically signi cant measurement, but if it is too large, the samples may be too heterogeneous for a robust trend. In our experiments described below, bins of xed size successfully identify Simpson's pairs, though we realize that more sophisticated binning techniques can allow us to isolate more pairs or reduce the number of false positives.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Trend Simpson's Paradox Algorithm 1 def trend_simpsons_pair (X ,</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Mathematical Analysis of the Paradox</head><p>We have presented a mathematical formulation of Simpson's paradox in terms of the derivatives of conditional expectations as given by Eqs. <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>and <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>, and we now examine these equations to get a be er insight into the origins and causes of this paradox. e expectation in Eq.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>We explore our approach using data from the question-answering platform called Stack Exchange. is platform, launched in 2008 to provide a forum for people to ask computer programming questions, grew over the years as a forum asking questions on a variety of technical and non-technical topics. e premise behind Stack Exchange is simple: any user can ask a question, which others may answer. Users can also vote for answers they nd helpful, and the asker can accept one of the answers as the best answer to the question. In this way, the Stack Exchange community collectively curates knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Stack Exchange Data</head><p>We used anonymized data representing all questions and answers from August 2008 until September 2014. 1 e data includes 9.6M questions, of which approximately half had an accepted answer. Only the questions that received two or more answers were included <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Previous studies of Stack Exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and other online platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, identi ed user sessions as an important variable in understanding performance. User actions, i.e., answering questions, can be segmented into sessions-periods of activity without a prolonged break. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> we use 100 minutes as minimum break length to de ne sessions. A time interval longer than 100 minutes between two answers constitutes the end of one session and the start of a new one. Note that the exact value of this threshold does not change results, but simply merge a small fraction of sessions into longer sessions.</p><p>To understand factors a ecting user performance on Stack Exchange, we study the relationship between user a ributes and the probability that the answer the user produces is accepted by the asker as best answer to his or her question. To this end, for each answer in the data set, we create a list of features describing the answer, as well as features of describing the user writing the answer:   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Simpson's Paradoxes on Stack Exchange</head><p>We apply the method described above to Stack Exchange data.</p><p>Here, our dependent variable Y is binary, denoting whether or not a speci c answer to a question was accepted as the best answer. In this case of binary outcomes we use the logistic regression linear model of the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">f (α + βx) = 1 1 + e −(α +β x ) .<label>(10)</label></formula><p>e parameters α and β are ed using Maximum likelihood, while test of the null hypothesis H 0 : β = 0 is performed using the Likelihood Ratio Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. e eleven variables in Stack Exchange data, result in 110 possible Simpson's pairs.

More interestingly, our approach also identi es previously unknown instances of Simpson's paradox. We explore these in greater detail below, illustrating how it can lead to deeper insights into online behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1">Answer Position &amp; Session Length.</head><p>We measure session length by the number of answers a user posts before taking an extended break. Session length was shown to be an important confounding variable in online activity. Analysis of the quality of comments posted on a social news platform Reddit showed that, once disaggregated by the length of session, the quality of comments declines over the course of a session, with each successive comment wri en by a user becoming shorter, less textually complex, receiving fewer responses and a lower score from others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Similarly, each successive answer posted during a session by a user on Stack Exchange is shorter, less well documented with external links and code, and less likely to be accepted by the asker as the best answer <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Our approach automatically identi es this example as Simpson's paradox, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. e gure shows average acceptance probability for an answer as a function of its position (or index) within a session. According to <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>, which reports aggregate acceptance probability, answers wri en later in a session are more likely to be accepted than earlier answers. However, once the same data is disaggregated by session length, the trend reverses ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1b)</ref>: each successive answer within the same session is less likely to be accepted than the previous answer. For example, for sessions during which ve answers were wri en, the rst answer is more likely to be accepted than the second answer, which is more likely to be accepted than the third answer, etc., which is more likely to be accepted than the h answer. e lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> represent ts to data using logistic regression.</p><p>is example highlights the necessity to properly disaggregate data to identify the subgroups for analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2">Number of Answers &amp; Reputation. Experience plays an important role in the quality of answers wri en by users. Stack</head><p>Exchange veterans, i.e., users who have been active on Stack Exchange for more than six months, post longer, be er documented answers, that are also more likely to be accepted as best answers by askers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>ere are several ways to measure experience on Stack Exchange. Reputation, according to Stack Exchange, gauges how much the community trusts a user to post good questions and provide useful answers. While reputation can be gained or lost with di erent actions, a more straightforward measure of experience is user tenure, which measures time since the user became active on Stack Exchange, or Percentile, normalized rank of a user's tenure. Alternately, experience can be measured by the Number of Answers a user posted during his or her tenure before writing the current answer.</p><p>Our method uncovers a novel Simpson's paradox for user experience variables Reputation and Number of Answers. In the aggregate data, acceptance probability increases as a function of the Number of Answers <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2a)</ref>. is is consistent with our expectations that the more experienced users-who have wri en more answers over their tenure on Stack Exchange-produce higher quality answers. However, when data is conditioned on Reputation, the trend reverses <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2b)</ref>. In other words, focusing on groups of users with the same reputation, those who have wri en more answers over their tenure are less likely to have a new answer accepted than the less active answerers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">e Origins of Simpson's paradox</head><p>To understand why Simpson's paradox occurs in Stack Exchange data, we illustrate the mathematical explanation of Section 3.2 with examples from our study. Consider the paradox for Answer Position-Session Length Simpson's pair, illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1a</ref>. In the disaggregated data, trend lines of acceptance probability for sessions of di erent length are stacked <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>: answers produced during longer sessions are more likely to be accepted than answers  Plots show the probability an answer is accepted as best answer as a function of the number of lifetime answers written by user over his or her tenure. (a) Acceptance probability calculated over aggregated data has an upward trend, with answers written by more experienced users (who have already posted more answers) more likely to be accepted as best answers. However, when data is disaggregated by reputation (b), the trend reverses. Among answers written by users with the same reputation (di erent colors represent reputation bins), those posted by users who had already written more answers are less likely to be accepted as best answers.</p><p>produced during shorter sessions. In addition, there are many more shorter sessions than longer ones. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> reports the number of sessions of di erent length. By far, the most common session has length one: users write only one answer during these sessions. Each longer session is about half as common as a session that is one answer shorter.</p><p>What happens to the trend in the aggregated data? When calculating acceptance probability as a function of answer position, all sessions contribute to acceptance probability for the rst answer of a session. Sessions of length one dominate the average. When calculating acceptance probability for answers in the second position, sessions of length one do not contribute, and acceptance probability is dominated by data from sessions of length two. Similarly, acceptance probability of answers in the third position is dominated by sessions of length three. Survivor bias excludes data from shorter sessions, which also have lower acceptance probability, creating an upward trend in acceptance probability. We back up this intuitive explanation with mathematical analysis of Section 3.2. Although acceptance probability is decreasing as a function of Answer Position for each value of Session Length <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1b)</ref>, the probability mass of Session Length is constantly moving towards larger values as Answer Position increases. Notice that as Answer Position increments from a to a + 1, sessions of length a are no longer included (as the minimum session length is now a + 1). us, while Session Length has probability mass Pr(X c = a|X p = a) when X p = a, it has probability Pr(X c = a|X p = a + 1) = 0 at X p = a + 1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">d dx p Pr(X c = a|X p = x p ) x p =a = − Pr(X c = a|X p = a).<label>(11)</label></formula><p>Meanwhile, for all other values of X c greater than a, the probability mass at X p = a + is the same as that at X p = a (as the number of data points is constant along sessions of same length) but normalized to account for the sessions of length a, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Pr(X c = x c |X p = a + 1) = Pr(X c = x c |X p = a) − Pr(X c = a|X p = a) .<label>(12)</label></formula><p>e rate of change of these probability masses with respect to</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">X p is d dx p Pr(X c = x c |X p = x p ) x p =a = 1 − Pr(X c = a|X p = a) − 1 Pr(X c = x c |X p = a).<label>(13)</label></formula><p>e probability mass function Pr(X c = x c |X p = a) decreases for X c = a corresponding to the smallest value of acceptance probability, while increasing for all other values X c &gt; a. Moreover, the rate of increase of this probability mass is greater than the rate at which the acceptance probability decreases, resulting in an upward trend when the data is aggregated.</p><p>A similar e ect plays out in the Number of Answers-Reputation Simpson's pair. <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> shows the heatmap of acceptance probability for di erent values of the Number of Answers wri en over a user's tenure and user Reputation, while <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref> shows the correlated joint distribution of the two variables. e gures illustrate the rst condition of Simpson's paradox (Eq. (7)): as X p changes, the distribution of the values of X c must also change. is dependency can be clearly seen in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3b</ref>-as X p = Number o f Answers increases then the distribution of X c = Reputation shi s to increasing values, which produces the paradox.</p><p>In the real world this means that users, who have wri en more answers are not more likely to have a new answer they write accepted. In fact, among users with same Reputation, those who earned this reputation with fewer answers are more likely to have a new answer they write accepted as best answer. is suggests that such users are simply be er at answering questions, and that this can be detected early in their tenure on Stack Exchange (while they still have low reputation). Note, however, that an exception to the trend reversal occurs for users with very high reputation. In Stack Exchange, users can gain reputation by "Answer is marked accepted", "Answer is voted up", " estion is voted up", etc. It seems that, high reputation users and low reputation users are di erent: for high reputation users, experience (number of wri en answers) is important, while for low reputation users the quality of answers, which may lead to votes, is more important. Analysis of this behavior is beyond the scope of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Discussion and Implications</head><p>Presence of a Simpson's paradox in data can indicate interesting or surprising pa erns <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and for trends in social data, important behavioral di erences within a population. Since social data is o en generated by a mixture of subgroups, existence of Simpson's Rep ≥ 10 5 Average <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Relationship between acceptance probability and Reputation Rate, a new measure of user performance dened as reputation per number of answers users wrote over their entire tenure. Each line represents a subgroup with a di erent reputation score. e much smaller variance compared to <ref type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> suggests that the new feature is a good proxy of answerer performance.</p><p>paradox suggests that these subgroups di er systematically and signi cantly in their behavior. By isolating important subgroups in social data, our method can yield insights into their behaviors.</p><p>For example, our method identi es Session Length as a conditioning variable for disaggregating data when studying trends in acceptance probability as a function of answer's position within a session. In fact, prior work has identi ed session length as an important parameter in studies of online performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Unless activity data is disaggregated into individual sessions-sequences of activity without an extended break-important pa erns are obscured. A pervasive pa ern in online platforms is user performance deterioration, whereby the quality of a user's contribution decreases over the course of a single session. is deterioration was observed for the quality of answers wri en on Stack Exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, comments posted on Reddit <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and the time spent reading posts on Facebook <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Our method automatically identi es position of an action within a session and session length as an important pair of variables describing Stack Exchange.</p><p>We examine in detail one novel paradox discovered by our method for the Reputation-Number of Answers variables. e trends in <ref type="figure">Fig. 2b</ref> suggest that both variables jointly a ect acceptance probability. Inspired by this observation, we construct a new variable-Reputation / Number of Answers-i.e., Reputation Rate. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows how acceptance probability changes with respect to Reputation Rate for di erent groups of users. ere is an strong upward trend, suggesting that answers provided by users with higher Reputation Rate are more likely to be accepted. Moreover, while the lines span reputations of an extremely broad range-from one to 100,000they collapse onto a single curve.</p><p>is suggests that Reputation Rate is a good proxy of user performance. e remaining paradoxes uncovered by our method could yield similarly interesting insights into user behavior on Stack Exchange.</p><p>We also illustrate the di erence between our method and linear models that model the outcome variable as a function of both X p and X c . For such multivariate linear models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, we can t a model f p,c (α + βX p + β c X c ) to the disaggregated data, and compare the sign of the coe cient β to the sign of the linear coe cient of the "aggregated" model f p (α + βX p ). In our method, we bin the values of X c and t separate linear models of the form of Eq. (4) in each bin of X c , aggregating by averaging the linear coe cient signs of each model. We claim that our approach has bene ts over multivariate linear models which allow it to nd Simpson's pairs where multivariate linear models can not. First, in multivariate linear models, all subgroups have the same coe cient β, and intercepts α + β c X c , which vary linearly with X c . In our method, however, each group can have di erent intercept and coe cient, which makes nding paradox pairs in heterogeneous data more exible. Indeed this exibility is necessary -from our results <ref type="figure">(Figs. 1b and 2b)</ref> it is clear that the trend parameters β(x c ) of the ed lines vary signi cantly depending on x c .</p><p>Secondly, our method of aggregating by simple averaging of the linear coe cient signs of the subgroups means that trends within each subgroup are weighted equally regardless of how many datapoints are in that subgroup. is is contrary to multivariate linear models, which t the model parameters based on each datapoint (and so weigh heavily towards values of X c with many datapoints). To illustrate, we show that our algorithm nds Time Since Previous Answer -Answer Position as a Simpson's pair, which a multivariate logistic regression does not.</p><p>e variable Answer Position is the index of the answer a user has completed without an extended (¿100 minute) break, and so Answer Position = 1 if Time Since Previous Answer ≥ 100 minutes and Answer Position &gt; 1 if Time Since Previous Answer &lt; 100 minutes. <ref type="figure">Fig. (5a)</ref> shows that, for Answer Position = 1, the acceptance probability decreases as a function of Time Since Previous Answer, possibly because be er users take shorter breaks. On the other hand, for other Answer Positions the trend is reversed, and acceptance probability increases with Time Since Previous Answer, suggesting that in short term, users who take more time to answer questions or take short breaks between questions write answers of higher quality.</p><p>Clearly, Time Since Previous Answer -Answer Position is an important Simpson's pair, illustrating that time has a bene cial e ect on answer quality ar short time scales. even though it is detrimental on the aggregate level. Multivariate logistic regression does not capture this behaviour, as 65% of the probability mass of Time Since Previous Answer is for values larger than 100 minutes, so when ing f p,c (α + βX p + β c X c ) to the data, it tries to t a hyperplane, which describes the majority of the data as best as possible, in this case the decreasing trend corresponding to Answer Position = 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented a method for systematically uncovering instances of Simpson's paradox in data. e method identi es pairs of variables, such that a trend in an outcome as a function of one variable disappears or reverses itself when the same data is disaggregated by conditioning it on the second variable. e disaggregated data corresponds to subgroups within the population generating the data. Our mathematical analysis suggests that Simspon's paradox is caused by both correlations between independent variables in data <ref type="figure">(Figs. 3b and 5b)</ref>, as well as di ering behaviour of the outcome variable within subgroups, illustrated here by the stacked curves of Figs. 1b and 2b. Failure to account for this e ect can lead analysis to wrong conclusions about typical behavior of individuals. We applied our method to real-world data from the questionanswering site Stack Exchange. We were speci cally interested in uncovering features a ecting the probability that an answer wri en by a user will be accepted by the asker as the best answer to his or her question. We identi ed eleven relevant features of answers and users. Not only did the method con rm an existing paradox, but it also uncovered new instances of Simpson's paradox.</p><p>Our work opens several directions for future work. e proposed algorithm could bene t from a more principled method to bin continuous data and more sophisticated techniques for re-aggregating the intercepts of the curves ed to disaggregated data. Also, while it appears that conditioning on X c disaggregates the population into more homogeneous subgroups, we have not used formal methods, such as goodness of t, to test for be er t of regression models to data. Goodness of t may also be used to guide data disaggregation strategies. In addition, our method applies to explicitly declared variables, and not to latent variables that may a ect data. While these and similar questions remain, our proposed method o ers a promising tool for the analysis of heterogeneous social data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Reputation:</head><label></label><figDesc>Answerer's reputation at the time he or she posted the answer. is score summarizes the user's cumulative contributions to Stack Exchange.
