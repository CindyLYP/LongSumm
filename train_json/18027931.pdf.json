Although the improvement in WM performance with cholinergic enhancement was a nonsignificant trend in the current study (P 5 0.07), in a previous study (9) with a larger sample (n 5 13) the effect was highly significant (P , 0.001). In the current study, we analyzed RT data for six of our seven subjects because the behavioral data for one subject were unavailable due to a computer failure. The difference in the significance of the two findings is simply a result of the difference in sample sizes. A power analysis shows that the size of the RT difference and variability in the current sample would yield a significant result (P 5 0.01) with a sample size of 13. During the memory trials, mean RT was 1180 ms during placebo and 1119 ms during physostigmine. During the control trials, mean RT was 735 ms during placebo and 709 ms during physostigmine, a difference that did not approach significance (P 5 0.24), suggesting that the effect of cholinergic enhancement on WM performance is not due to a nonspecific increase in arousal.\n18. Matched-pair t tests (two-tailed) were used to test the significance of drug-related changes in the volume of regions of interest that showed significant response contrasts.\n19. H. Sato, Y. Hata, H.

Tenenbaum,1* Vin de Silva,2 John C. Langford3\nScientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.\nA canonical problem in dimensionality reduction from the domain of visual perception is illustrated in Fig. 1A. The input consists of many images of a person’s face observed under different pose and lighting conditions, in no particular order. These images can be thought of as points in a high-dimensional vector space, with each input dimension corresponding to the brightness of one pixel in the image or the firing rate of one retinal ganglion cell. Although the input dimensionality may be quite high (e.g., 4096 for these 64 pixel by 64 pixel images), the perceptually meaningful structure of these images has many fewer independent degrees of freedom. Within the 4096-dimensional input space, all of the images lie on an intrinsically threedimensional manifold, or constraint surface, that can be parameterized by two pose variables plus an azimuthal lighting angle. Our goal is to discover, given only the unordered high-dimensional inputs, low-dimensional representations such as Fig. 1A with coordinates that capture the intrinsic degrees of freedom of a data set. This problem is of central importance not only in studies of vision (1–5), but also in speech (6, 7), motor control (8, 9), and a range of other physical and biological sciences (10–12).\nThe classical techniques for dimensionality reduction, PCA and MDS, are simple to implement, efficiently computable, and guaranteed to discover the true structure of data lying on or near a linear subspace of the high-dimensional input space (13). PCA finds a low-dimensional embedding of the data points that best preserves their variance as measured in the high-dimensional input space. Classical MDS finds an embedding that preserves the interpoint distances, equivalent to PCA when those distances are Euclidean. However, many data sets contain essential nonlinear structures that are invisible to PCA and MDS (4, 5, 11, 14). For example, both methods fail to detect the true degrees of freedom of the face data set (Fig. 1A), or even its intrinsic three-dimensionality (Fig. 2A).\nHere we describe an approach that combines the major algorithmic features of PCA and MDS—computational efficiency, global optimality, and asymptotic convergence guarantees—with the flexibility to learn a broad class of nonlinear manifolds. Figure 3A illustrates the challenge of nonlinearity with data lying on a two-dimensional “Swiss roll”: points far apart on the underlying manifold, as measured by their geodesic, or shortest path, distances, may appear deceptively close in the high-dimensional input space, as measured by their straight-line Euclidean distance. Only the geodesic distances reflect the true low-dimensional geometry of the manifold, but PCA and MDS effectively see just the Euclidean structure; thus, they fail to detect the intrinsic twodimensionality (Fig. 2B).\nOur approach builds on classical MDS but seeks to preserve the intrinsic geometry of the data, as captured in the geodesic manifold distances between all pairs of data points. The crux is estimating the geodesic distance between faraway points, given only input-space distances. For neighboring points, inputspace distance provides a good approxima1Department of Psychology and 2Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. 3Department of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15217, USA. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

For faraway points, geodesic distance can be approximated by adding up a sequence of “short hops” between neighboring points. These approximations are computed efficiently by finding shortest paths in a graph with edges connecting neighboring data points.\nThe complete isometric feature mapping, or Isomap, algorithm has three steps, which are detailed in Table 1. The first step determines which points are neighbors on the manifold M, based on the distances dX (i, j) between pairs of points i, j in the input space\nX. Two simple methods are to connect each point to all points within some fixed radius e, or to all of its K nearest neighbors (15). These neighborhood relations are represented as a weighted graph G over the data points, with edges of weight dX(i, j) between neighboring points (Fig. 3B).\nIn its second step, Isomap estimates the geodesic distances dM (i, j) between all pairs of points on the manifold M by computing their shortest path distances dG(i, j) in the graph G. One simple algorithm (16) for finding shortest paths is given in Table 1.\nThe final step applies classical MDS to the matrix of graph distances DG 5 {dG(i, j)}, constructing an embedding of the data in a d-dimensional Euclidean space Y that best preserves the manifold’s estimated intrinsic geometry (Fig. 3C). The coordinate vectors yi for points in Y are chosen to minimize the cost function\nE 5 \\t~DG! 2 t~DY!\\L2 (1)\nwhere DY denotes the matrix of Euclidean distances {dY(i, j) 5 \\yi 2 yj\\} and \\A\\L2 the L2 matrix norm =Si, j Ai j 2 . The t operator\nFig. 1. (A) A canonical dimensionality reduction problem from visual perception. The input consists of a sequence of 4096-dimensional vectors, representing the brightness values of 64 pixel by 64 pixel images of a face rendered with different poses and lighting directions. Applied to N 5 698 raw images, Isomap (K 5 6) learns a three-dimensional embedding of the data’s intrinsic geometric structure. A two-dimensional projection is shown, with a sample of the original input images (red circles) superimposed on all the data points (blue) and horizontal sliders (under the images) representing the third dimension. Each coordinate axis of the embedding correlates highly with one degree of freedom underlying the original data: leftright pose (x axis, R 5 0.99), up-down pose ( y axis, R 5 0.90), and lighting direction (slider position, R 5 0.92). The input-space distances dX(i, j ) given to Isomap were Euclidean distances between the 4096-dimensional image vectors. (B) Isomap applied to N 5 1000 handwritten “2”s from the MNIST database (40). The two most significant dimensions in the Isomap embedding, shown here, articulate the major features of the “2”: bottom loop (x axis) and top arch ( y axis). Input-space distances dX(i, j ) were measured by tangent distance, a metric designed to capture the invariances relevant in handwriting recognition (41). Here we used e-Isomap (with e 5 4.2) because we did not expect a constant dimensionality to hold over the whole data set; consistent with this, Isomap finds several tendrils projecting from the higher dimensional mass of data and representing successive exaggerations of an extra stroke or ornament in the digit.\n22 DECEMBER 2000 VOL 290 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org2320\nconverts distances to inner products (17), which uniquely characterize the geometry of the data in a form that supports efficient optimization. The global minimum of Eq. 1 is achieved by setting the coordinates yi to the top d eigenvectors of the matrix t(DG) (13).\nAs with PCA or MDS, the true dimensionality of the data can be estimated from the decrease in error as the dimensionality of Y is increased. For the Swiss roll, where classical methods fail, the residual variance of Isomap correctly bottoms out at d 5 2 (Fig. 2B).\nJust as PCA and MDS are guaranteed, given sufficient data, to recover the true structure of linear manifolds, Isomap is guaranteed asymptotically to recover the true dimensionality and geometric structure of a strictly larger class of nonlinear manifolds. Like the Swiss roll, these are manifolds\nwhose intrinsic geometry is that of a convex region of Euclidean space, but whose ambient geometry in the high-dimensional input space may be highly folded, twisted, or curved. For non-Euclidean manifolds, such as a hemisphere or the surface of a doughnut, Isomap still produces a globally optimal lowdimensional Euclidean representation, as measured by Eq. 1.\nThese guarantees of asymptotic convergence rest on a proof that as the number of data points increases, the graph distances dG(i, j) provide increasingly better approximations to the intrinsic geodesic distances dM(i, j), becoming arbitrarily accurate in the limit of infinite data (18, 19). How quickly dG(i, j) converges to dM(i, j) depends on certain parameters of the manifold as it lies within the high-dimensional space (radius of curvature and branch separation) and on the\ndensity of points. To the extent that a data set presents extreme values of these parameters or deviates from a uniform density, asymptotic convergence still holds in general, but the sample size required to estimate geodesic distance accurately may be impractically large.\nIsomap’s global coordinates provide a simple way to analyze and manipulate highdimensional observations in terms of their intrinsic nonlinear degrees of freedom. For a set of synthetic face images, known to have three degrees of freedom, Isomap correctly detects the dimensionality (Fig. 2A) and separates out the true underlying factors (Fig. 1A). The algorithm also recovers the known low-dimensional structure of a set of noisy real images, generated by a human hand varying in finger extension and wrist rotation (Fig. 2C) (20). Given a more complex data set of handwritten digits, which does not have a clear manifold geometry, Isomap still finds globally meaningful coordinates (Fig. 1B) and nonlinear structure that PCA or MDS do not detect (Fig. 2D). For all three data sets, the natural appearance of linear interpolations between distant points in the low-dimensional coordinate space confirms that Isomap has captured the data’s perceptually relevant structure (Fig. 4).\nPrevious attempts to extend PCA and MDS to nonlinear data sets fall into two broad classes, each of which suffers from limitations overcome by our approach. Local linear techniques (21–23) are not designed to represent the global structure of a data set within a single coordinate system, as we do in Fig. 1. Nonlinear techniques based on greedy optimization procedures (24–30) attempt to discover global structure, but lack the crucial algorithmic features that Isomap inherits from PCA and MDS: a noniterative, polynomial time procedure with a guarantee of global optimality; for intrinsically Euclidean man-\nat which this curve ceases to decrease significantly with added dimensions. Arrows mark the true or approximate dimensionality, when known.

Isomap complements, and may be combined with, linear extensions of PCA based on higher order statistics, such as independent component analysis (31, 32). It may also lead to a better understanding of how the brain comes to represent the dynamic appearance of objects, where psychophysical studies of apparent motion (33, 34) suggest a central role for geodesic transformations on nonlinear manifolds (35) much like those studied here.\nReferences and Notes 1.

The scale-invariant K parameter is typically easier to\nset than e, but may yield misleading results when the\nlocal dimensionality varies across the data set. When available, additional constraints such as the temporal ordering of observations may also help to determine neighbors. In earlier work (36) we explored a more complex method (37), which required an order of magnitude more data and did not support the theoretical performance guarantees we provide here for e- and K-Isomap. 16. This procedure, known as Floyd’s algorithm, requires O(N3) operations. More efficient algorithms exploiting the sparse structure of the neighborhood graph can be found in (38). 17. The operator t is defined by t(D) 5 2HSH/2, where S is the matrix of squared distances {Sij 5 Di j\n2}, and H is the “centering matrix” {Hij 5 dij 2 1/N} (13). 18. Our proof works by showing that for a sufficiently high density (a) of data points, we can always choose a neighborhood size (e or K) large enough that the graph will (with high probability) have a path not much longer than the true geodesic, but small enough to prevent edges that “short circuit” the true geometry of the manifold. More precisely, given arbitrarily small values of l1, l2, and m, we can guarantee that with probability at least 1 2 m, estimates of the form\n~1 2 l1!dM~i, j! # dG~i, j! # ~1 1 l2!dM~i, j!\nwill hold uniformly over all pairs of data points i, j.

Saul2\nMany areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.\nHow do we judge similarity? Our mental representations of the world are formed by processing large numbers of sensory inputs—including, for example, the pixel intensities of images, the power spectra of sounds, and the joint angles of articulated bodies. While complex stimuli of this form can be represented by points in a high-dimensional vector space, they typically have a much more compact description. Coherent structure in the world leads to strong correlations between inputs (such as between neighboring pixels in images), generating observations that lie on or close to a smooth low-dimensional manifold. To compare and classify such observations—in effect, to reason about the world—depends crucially on modeling the nonlinear geometry of these low-dimensional manifolds.\nScientists interested in exploratory analysis or visualization of multivariate data (1) face a similar problem in dimensionality reduction. The problem, as illustrated in Fig. 1, involves mapping high-dimensional inputs into a lowdimensional “description” space with as many\ncoordinates as observed modes of variability. Previous approaches to this problem, based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) (2), have computed embeddings that attempt to preserve pairwise distances [or generalized disparities (3)] between data points; these distances are measured along straight lines or, in more sophisticated usages of MDS such as Isomap (4),\nalong shortest paths confined to the manifold of observed inputs. Here, we take a different approach, called locally linear embedding (LLE), that eliminates the need to estimate pairwise distances between widely separated data points. Unlike previous methods, LLE recovers global nonlinear structure from locally linear fits.\nThe LLE algorithm, summarized in Fig. 2, is based on simple geometric intuitions. Suppose the data consist of N real-valued vectors WXi, each of dimensionality D, sampled from some underlying manifold. Provided there is sufficient data (such that the manifold is well-sampled), we expect each data point and its neighbors to lie on or close to a locally linear patch of the manifold. We characterize the local geometry of these patches by linear coefficients that reconstruct each data point from its neighbors. Reconstruction errors are measured by the cost function\nε~W ! 5 O i U WXi2SjWij WXjU 2\n(1)\nwhich adds up the squared distances between all the data points and their reconstructions. The weights Wij summarize the contribution of the jth data point to the ith reconstruction. To compute the weights Wij, we minimize the cost\n1Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, 17 Queen Square, London WC1N 3AR, UK. 2AT&T Lab—Research, 180 Park Avenue, Florham Park, NJ 07932, USA.\nE-mail: roweis@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk (S.T.R.); lsaul@research. att.com (L.K.S.) Fig. 1. The problem of nonlinear dimensionality reduction, as illustrated (10) for three-dimensional data (B) sampled from a two-dimensional manifold (A). An unsupervised learning algorithm must discover the global internal coordinates of the manifold without signals that explicitly indicate how the data should be embedded in two dimensions. The color coding illustrates the neighborhoodpreserving mapping discovered by LLE; black outlines in (B) and (C) show the neighborhood of a single point. Unlike LLE, projections of the data by principal component analysis (PCA) (28) or classical MDS (2) map faraway data points to nearby points in the plane, failing to identify the underlying structure of the manifold. Note that mixture models for local dimensionality reduction (29), which cluster the data and perform PCA within each cluster, do not address the problem considered here: namely, how to map high-dimensional data into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality.\nwww.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 290 22 DECEMBER 2000 2323"

Although the improvement in WM performance with cholinergic enhancement was a nonsignificant trend in the current study (P 5 0.07), in a previous study (9) with a larger sample (n 5 13) the effect was highly significant (P , 0.001). In the current study, we analyzed RT data for six of our seven subjects because the behavioral data for one subject were unavailable due to a computer failure. The difference in the significance of the two findings is simply a result of the difference in sample sizes. A power analysis shows that the size of the RT difference and variability in the current sample would yield a significant result (P 5 0.01) with a sample size of 13. During the memory trials, mean RT was 1180 ms during placebo and 1119 ms during physostigmine. During the control trials, mean RT was 735 ms during placebo and 709 ms during physostigmine, a difference that did not approach significance (P 5 0.24), suggesting that the effect of cholinergic enhancement on WM performance is not due to a nonspecific increase in arousal. 18. Matched-pair t tests (two-tailed) were used to test the significance of drug-related changes in the volume of regions of interest that showed significant response contrasts. 19. H. Sato, Y. Hata, H.
