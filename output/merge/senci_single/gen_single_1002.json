{"1002": "the rate of publications of scientific papers is increasing and it is almost impossible for re- searchers to keep up with relevant research. currently, no large- scale training data is available for the task of scientific paper summarization. in this paper, we propose a novel method that automatically generates summaries for scientific papers , by utilizing videos of talks at scientific conferences. we hypothesize that such talks constitute a coherent and concise description of the papers of content, and can form the basis for good summaries. we collected papers and their corresponding videos, and created a dataset of paper summaries. a model trained on this dataset achieves similar performance as models trained on a dataset of summaries created manually. in addition, we validated the quality of our summaries by human experts. alignment between spo- ken words and sentences in the paper, assuming the following generative process: during the talk, the speaker generates words for describing ver- bally sentences from the paper, one word at each time step. thus, at each time step, the speaker has a single sentence from the paper in mind, and produces a word that constitutes a part of its ver- bal description. then, at the next time-step, the speaker either stays with the same sentence, or moves on to describing another sentence, and so on. thus, given the transcript, the number of words uttered to describe each sentence can serve as importance score, in- dicating the amount of time the speaker spent de- scribing the sentence. this enables to control the summary length by considering only the number of words uttered to describe each sentence. in this paper, we propose a new method for paper summarization called hmm ( hmm stands for speaker matrix matrix matrix of transition probabilities) . this matrix is used to model the speaker matrix of the paper , and the transitions between any two sentences in the paper. we propose a novel automatic method to gener- ate training data for scientific papers summariza- tion, based on conference talks given by authors. we show that a model trained on our dataset achieves the competitive results compared to models trained on human generated summaries, and that the dataset quality satisfies human experts. in the future, we plan to study the effect of other video modalities on the alignment algorithm. we use an hmm to model the assumed genera- tive process: during the talk, the speaker generates words for describing ver- bally sentences from the paper, one word at each time step. given the transcript, we aim to retrieve those source sentences and use them as the sum- mary. this enables to control the summary length by considering only the most most im- portant sentences up to some threshold. moreover, our approach can generate sum- maries of various lengths.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1003": "###", "1004": "###", "1005": "###", "1006": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###", "1009": "###", "1010": "###", "1011": "###", "1012": "###", "1013": "###", "1014": "###", "1015": "###", "1016": "###", "1017": "###", "1018": "###", "1019": "###", "1020": "###", "1021": "###"}
