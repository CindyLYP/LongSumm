				<p>Nearly all previous work on neural machine translation (NMT) has used quite restricted vocabularies, perhaps with a subsequent method to patch in unknown words. This paper presents a novel wordcharacter solution to achieving open vocabulary NMT. We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word level and consult the character components for rare words. Our character-level recurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recover unknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybrid approach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-based ones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of word-based models. On the WMT&apos;15 English to Czech translation task, this hybrid approach offers an addition boost of +2.1−11.4 BLEU points over models that already handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-art result with 20.7 BLEU score. We demonstrate that our character models can successfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, a highly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary, but also build correct representations for English source words. We run Barnes-Hut-SNE algorithm over a set of 91 words, but filter out 27 words for displaying clarity.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a simple new architecture for getting machines to translate.</p><p>At its core, NMT is a single deep neural network that is trained end-to-end with several advantages such as simplicity and generalization. Despite being relatively new, <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>: Hybrid NMT -example of a wordcharacter model for translating "a cute cat" into "un joli chat". Hybrid NMT translates at the word level. For rare tokens, the character-level components build source representations and recover target &lt;unk&gt;. "_" marks sequence boundaries.</p><p>NMT has already achieved state-of-the-art translation results for several language pairs such as English-French <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Luong et al., 2015b)</ref>, English-German <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Jean et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Luong et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Luong and Manning, 2015)</ref>, and English-Czech <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jean et al., 2015b)</ref>.</p><p>While NMT offers many advantages over traditional phrase-based approaches, such as small memory footprint and simple decoder implementation, nearly all previous work in NMT has used quite restricted vocabularies, crudely treating all other words the same with an &lt;unk&gt; symbol. Sometimes, a post-processing step that patches in unknown words is introduced to alleviate this problem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Luong et al. (2015b)</ref> propose to annotate occurrences of target &lt;unk&gt; with positional information to track their alignments, after which simple word dictionary lookup or identity copy can be performed to replace &lt;unk&gt; in the translation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jean et al. (2015a)</ref> approach the problem similarly but obtain the alignments for unknown words from the attention mechanism. We refer to these as the unk replacement technique.</p><p>Though simple, these approaches ignore several important properties of languages. First, monolingually, words are morphologically related; however, they are currently treated as independent entities. This is problematic as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Luong et al. (2013)</ref>: neural networks can learn good representations for frequent words such as "distinct", but fail for rarebut-related words like "distinctiveness". Second, crosslingually, languages have different alphabets, so one cannot naïvely memorize all possible surface word translations such as name transliteration between "Christopher" (English) and "Krystof" <ref type="bibr">(Czech)</ref>. See more on this problem in <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Sennrich et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel hybrid architecture for NMT that translates mostly at the word level and consults the character components for rare words when necessary. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, our hybrid model consists of a word-based NMT that performs most of the translation job, except for the two (hypothetically) rare words, "cute" and "joli", that are handled separately. On the source side, representations for rare words, "cute", are computed on-thefly using a deep recurrent neural network that operates at the character level. On the target side, we have a separate model that recovers the surface forms, "joli", of &lt;unk&gt; tokens character-bycharacter. These components are learned jointly end-to-end, removing the need for a separate unk replacement step as in current NMT practice.</p><p>Our hybrid NMT offers a twofold advantage: it is much faster and easier to train than characterbased models; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of word-based ones. We demonstrate at scale that on the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task, such a hybrid approach provides an additional boost of +2.1−11.4 BLEU points over models that already handle unknown words. We achieve a new state-of-theart result with 20.7 BLEU score. Our analysis demonstrates that our character models can successfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, a highly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary, but also build correct representations for English source words.</p><p>We provide code, data, and models at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>There has been a recent line of work on end-to-end character-based neural models which achieve good results for part-of-speech tagging <ref type="bibr">(dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ling et al., 2015a)</ref>, dependency parsing <ref type="bibr">(Ballesteros et al., 2015)</ref>, text classification <ref type="bibr">(Zhang et al., 2015)</ref>, speech recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bahdanau et al., 2016)</ref>, and language modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kim et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Jozefowicz et al., 2016)</ref>. However, success has not been shown for cross-lingual tasks such as machine translation. <ref type="bibr">1</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Sennrich et al. (2016)</ref> propose to segment words into smaller units and translate just like at the word level, which does not learn to understand relationships among words.</p><p>Our work takes inspiration from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Luong et al., 2013)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Li et al., 2015)</ref>. Similar to the former, we build representations for rare words on-the-fly from subword units. However, we utilize recurrent neural networks with characters as the basic units; whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Luong et al. (2013)</ref> use recursive neural networks with morphemes as units, which requires existence of a morphological analyzer. In comparison with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Li et al., 2015)</ref>, our hybrid architecture is also a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model, but operates at a different granularity level, word-character. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Li et al. (2015)</ref> build hierarchical models at the sentence-word level for paragraphs and documents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background &amp; Our Models</head><p>Neural machine translation aims to directly model the conditional probability p(y|x) of translating a source sentence, x 1 , . . . , x n , to a target sentence, y 1 , . . . , y m . It accomplishes this goal through an encoder-decoder framework <ref type="bibr">(Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cho et al., 2014)</ref>. The encoder computes a representation s for each source sentence. Based on that source representation, the decoder generates a translation, one target word at a time, and hence, decomposes the log conditional probability as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">log p(y|x) = m t=1 log p (y t |y &lt;t , s) (1)</formula><p>A natural model for sequential data is the recurrent neural network (RNN), used by most of the recent NMT work. Papers, however, differ in terms of: (a) architecture -from unidirectional, to bidirectional, and deep multi-layer RNNs; and (b) RNN type -which are long short-term memory (LSTM) <ref type="bibr">(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)</ref> and the gated recurrent unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cho et al., 2014)</ref>. All our models utilize the deep multi-layer architecture with LSTM as the recurrent unit; detailed formulations are in <ref type="bibr">(Zaremba et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Considering the top recurrent layer in a deep LSTM, with h t being the current target hidden state as in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, one can compute the probability of decoding each target word y t as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p (y t |y &lt;t , s) = softmax (h t )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>For a parallel corpus D, we train our model by minimizing the below cross-entropy loss:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">J = (x,y)∈D − log p(y|x)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Attention Mechanism -The early NMT approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Sutskever et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cho et al., 2014</ref>), which we have described above, use only the last encoder state to initialize the decoder, i.e., setting the input representation s in Eq.</p><p>(1) to [h n ]. Recently, Bahdanau et al. <ref type="formula">2015</ref>propose an attention mechanism, a form of random access memory for NMT to cope with long input sequences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Luong et al. (2015a)</ref> further extend the attention mechanism to different scoring functions, used to compare source and target hidden states, as well as different strategies to place the attention. In all our models, we utilize the global attention mechanism and the bilinear form for the attention scoring function similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Luong et al., 2015a)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, we set s in Eq. (1) to the set of source hidden states at the top layer, [h 1 , . . . ,h n ]. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, the attention mechanism consists of two stages: (a) context vector -the <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Attention mechanism.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y t c t h 1hn h t h t</formula><p>current hidden state h t is compared with individual source hidden states in s to learn an alignment vector, which is then used to compute the context vector c t as a weighted average of s; and (b) attentional hidden state -the context vector c t is then used to derive a new attentional hidden state:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h t = tanh(W[c t ; h t ])<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The attentional vectorh t then replaces h t in Eq.</p><p>(2) in predicting the next word.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hybrid Neural Machine Translation</head><p>Our hybrid architecture, illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, leverages the power of both words and characters to achieve the goal of open vocabulary NMT. The core of the design is a word-level NMT with the advantage of being fast and easy to train. The character components empower the word-level system with the abilities to compute any source word representation on the fly from characters and to recover character-by-character unknown target words originally produced as &lt;unk&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Word-based Translation as a Backbone</head><p>The core of our hybrid NMT is a deep LSTM encoder-decoder that translates at the word level as described in Section 3. We maintain a vocabulary of |V | frequent words for each language. Other words not inside these lists are represented by a universal symbol &lt;unk&gt;, one per language. We translate just like a word-based NMT system with respect to these source and target vocabularies, except for cases that involve &lt;unk&gt; in the source in-put or the target output. These correspond to the character-level components illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. A nice property of our hybrid approach is that by varying the vocabulary size, one can control how much to blend the word-and character-based models; hence, taking the best of both worlds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Source Character-based Representation</head><p>In regular word-based NMT, for all rare words outside the source vocabulary, one feeds the universal embedding representing &lt;unk&gt; as input to the encoder. This is problematic because it discards valuable information about the source word. To fix that, we learn a deep LSTM model over characters of source words. For example, in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, we run our deep character-based LSTM over 'c', 'u', 't', 'e', and '_' (the boundary symbol). The final hidden state at the top layer will be used as the on-the-fly representation for the current rare word.</p><p>The layers of the deep character-based LSTM are always initialized with zero states. One might propose to connect hidden states of the wordbased LSTM to the character-based model; however, we chose this design for various reasons. First, it simplifies the architecture. Second, it allows for efficiency through precomputation: before each mini-batch, we can compute representations for rare source words all at once. All instances of the same word share the same embedding, so the computation is per type. 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Target Character-level Generation</head><p>General word-based NMT allows generation of &lt;unk&gt; in the target output. Afterwards, there is usually a post-processing step that handles these unknown tokens by utilizing the alignment information derived from the attention mechanism and then performing simple word dictionary lookup or identity copy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Luong et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jean et al., 2015a)</ref>. While this approach works, it suffers from various problems such as alphabet mismatches between the source and target vocabularies and multi-word alignments. Our goal is to address all these issues and create a coherent framework that handles an unlimited output vocabulary.</p><p>Our solution is to have a separate deep LSTM that "translates" at the character level given the <ref type="bibr">While Ling et al. (2015b)</ref> found that it is slow and difficult to train source character-level models and had to resort to pretraining, we demonstrate later that we can train our deep character-level LSTM perfectly fine in an end-to-end fashion. current word-level state. We train our system such that whenever the word-level NMT produces an &lt;unk&gt;, we can consult this character-level decoder to recover the correct surface form of the unknown target word. This is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The training objective in Eq. (3) now becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">J = J w + αJ c<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Here, J w refers to the usual loss of the wordlevel NMT; in our example, it is the sum of the negative log likelihood of generating {"un", "&lt;unk&gt;", "chat", "_"}. The remaining component J c corresponds to the loss incurred by the character-level decoder when predicting characters, e.g., {'j', 'o', 'l', 'i', '_'}, of those rare words not in the target vocabulary.</p><p>Hidden-state Initialization Unlike the source character-based representations, which are context-independent, the target character-level generation requires the current word-level context to produce meaningful translation. This brings up an important question about what can best represent the current context so as to initialize the character-level decoder. We answer this question in the context of the attention mechanism ( §3). The final vectorh t , just before the softmax as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, seems to be a good candidate to initialize the character-level decoder. The reason is thath t combines information from both the context vector c t and the top-level recurrent state h t . We refer to it later in our experiments as the same-path target generation approach.</p><p>On the other hand, the same-path approach worries us because all vectorsh t used to seed the character-level decoder might have similar values, leading to the same character sequence being produced. The reason is becauseh t is directly used in the softmax, Eq. (2), to predict the same &lt;unk&gt;. That might pose some challenges for the model to learn useful representations that can be used to accomplish two tasks at the same time, that is to predict &lt;unk&gt; and to generate character sequences. To address that concern, we propose another approach called the separate-path target generation.</p><p>Our separate-path target generation approach works as follows. We mimic the process described in Eq. (4) to create a counterpart vectorh t that will be used to seed the character-level decoder:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">h t = tanh(W [c t ; h t ])<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Here,W is a new learnable parameter matrix, with which we hope to release W from the pressure of having to extract information relevant to both the word-and character-generation processes. Only the hidden state of the first layer is initialized as discussed above. The other components in the character-level decoder such as the LSTM cells of all layers and the hidden states of higher layers, all start with zero values. Implementation-wise, the computation in the character-level decoder is done per word token instead of per type as in the source character component ( §4.2). This is because of the contextdependent nature of the decoder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Word-Character Generation Strategy</head><p>With the character-level decoder, we can view the final hidden states as representations for the surface forms of unknown tokens and could have fed these to the next time step. However, we chose not to do so for the efficiency reason explained next; instead, &lt;unk&gt; is fed to the word-level decoder "as is" using its corresponding word embedding.</p><p>During training, this design choice decouples all executions over &lt;unk&gt; instances of the character-level decoder as soon the word-level NMT completes. As such, the forward and backward passes of the character-level decoder over rare words can be invoked in batch mode. At test time, our strategy is to first run a beam search decoder at the word level to find the best translations given by the word-level NMT. Such translations contains &lt;unk&gt; tokens, so we utilize our character-level decoder with beam search to generate actual words for these &lt;unk&gt;.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments</head><p>We evaluate the effectiveness of our models on the publicly available WMT'15 translation task from English into Czech with new-stest2013 (3000 sentences) as a development set and newstest2015 (2656 sentences) as a test set.</p><p>Two metrics are used: case-sensitive NIST BLEU <ref type="bibr">(Papineni et al., 2002)</ref> and chrF 3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Popović, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> The latter measures the amounts of overlapping character n-grams and has been argued to be a better metric for translation tasks out of English. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">word  char  word  char  # Sents  15.8M  # Tokens 254M 1,269M 224M 1,347M  # Types  1,172K  2003  1,760K  2053  200-char</ref> 98.1% 98.8% <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: WMT'15 English-Czech data -shown are various statistics of our training data such as sentence, token (word and character counts), as well as type (sizes of the word and character vocabularies).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>English Czech</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Data</head><p>Among the available language pairs in WMT'15, all involving English, we choose Czech as a target language for several reasons. First and foremost, Czech is a Slavic language with not only rich and complex inflection, but also fusional morphology in which a single morpheme can encode multiple grammatical, syntactic, or semantic meanings. As a result, Czech possesses an enormously large vocabulary (about 1.5 to 2 times bigger than that of English according to statistics in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>) and is a challenging language to translate into. Furthermore, this language pair has a large amount of training data, so we can evaluate at scale. Lastly, though our techniques are language independent, it is easier for us to work with Czech since Czech uses the Latin alphabet with some diacritics. In terms of preprocessing, we apply only the standard tokenization practice. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We choose for each language a list of 200 characters found in frequent words, which, as shown in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, can represent more than 98% of the vocabulary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Training Details</head><p>We train three types of systems, purely wordbased, purely character-based, and hybrid. Common to these architectures is a word-based NMT since the character-based systems are essentially word-based ones with longer sequences and the core of hybrid models is also a word-based NMT.</p><p>In training word-based NMT, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Luong et al. (2015a)</ref> to use the global attention mechanism together with similar hyperparameters: (a) deep LSTM models, 4 layers, 1024 cells, and 1024-dimensional embeddings, (b  initialization of parameters in [−0.1, 0.1], (c) 6epoch training with plain SGD and a simple learning rate schedule -start with a learning rate of 1.0; after 4 epochs, halve the learning rate every 0.5 epoch, (d) mini-batches are of size 128 and shuffled, (e) the gradient is rescaled whenever its norm exceeds 5, and (f) dropout is used with probability 0.2 according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Pham et al., 2014)</ref>. We now detail differences across the three architectures. Word-based NMT -We constrain our source and target sequences to have a maximum length of 50 each; words that go past the boundary are ignored. The vocabularies are limited to the top |V | most frequent words in both languages. Words not in these vocabularies are converted into &lt;unk&gt;. After translating, we will perform dictionary 5 lookup or identity copy for &lt;unk&gt; using the alignment information from the attention models. Such procedure is referred as the unk replace technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Luong et al., 2015b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Jean et al., 2015a)</ref>.</p><p>Character-based NMT -The source and target sequences at the character level are often about 5 times longer than their counterparts in the wordbased models as we can infer from the statistics in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Due to memory constraint in GPUs, we</p><p>Obtained from the alignment links produced by the Berkeley aligner <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Liang et al., 2006)</ref> over the training corpus. limit our source and target sequences to a maximum length of 150 each, i.e., we backpropagate through at most 300 timesteps from the decoder to the encoder. With smaller 512-dimensional models, we can afford to have longer sequences with up to 600-step backpropagation.</p><p>Hybrid NMT -The word-level component uses the same settings as the purely word-based NMT. For the character-level source and target components, we experiment with both shallow and deep 1024-dimensional models of 1 and 2 LSTM layers. We set the weight α in Eq. (5) for our character-level loss to 1.0.</p><p>Training Time -It takes about 3 weeks to train a word-based model with |V | = 50K and about 3 months to train a character-based model. Training and testing for the hybrid models are about 10-20% slower than those of the word-based models with the same vocabulary size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Results</head><p>We compare our models with several strong systems. These include the winning entry in WMT'15, which was trained on a much larger amount of data, 52.6M parallel and 393.0M mono-lingual sentences (Bojar and Tamchyna, 2015). <ref type="bibr">6</ref> In contrast, we merely use the provided parallel corpus of 15.8M sentences. For NMT, to the best of our knowledge, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jean et al., 2015b)</ref> has the best published performance on English-Czech.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, for a purely word-based approach, our single NMT model outperforms the best single model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jean et al., 2015b)</ref> by +1.8 points despite using a smaller vocabulary of only 50K words versus 200K words. Our ensemble system (e) slightly outperforms the best previous NMT system with 18.4 BLEU.</p><p>To our surprise, purely character-based models, though extremely slow to train and test, perform quite well. The 512-dimensional attention-based model (g) is best, surpassing the single wordbased model in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Jean et al., 2015b)</ref> despite having much fewer parameters. It even outperforms most NMT systems on chrF 3 with 46.6 points. This indicates that this model translate words that closely but not exactly match the reference ones as evidenced in Section 6.3. We notice two interesting observations. First, attention is critical for character-based models to work as is obvious from the poor performance of the non-attentional model; this has also been shown in speech recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Chan et al., 2016)</ref>. Second, long time-step backpropagation is more important as reflected by the fact that the larger 1024-dimensional model (h) with shorter backprogration is inferior to (g).</p><p>Our hybrid models achieve the best results. At 10K words, we demonstrate that our separatepath strategy for the character-level target generation ( §4.3) is effective, yielding an improvement of +1.5 BLEU points when comparing systems (j) vs. (i). A deeper character-level architecture of 2 LSTM layers provides another significant boost of +2.1 BLEU. With 17.7 BLEU points, our hybrid system (k) has surpassed word-level NMT models.</p><p>When extending to 50K words, we further improve the translation quality. Our best single model, system (l) with 19.6 BLEU, is already better than all existing systems. Our ensemble model (m) further advances the SOTA result to 20.7 BLEU, outperforming the winning entry in the WMT'15 English-Czech translation task by a large margin of +1.9 points. Our ensemble model  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Vocabulary size effect -shown are the performances of different systems as we vary their vocabulary sizes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Analysis</head><p>This section first studies the effects of vocabulary sizes towards translation quality. We then analyze more carefully our character-level components by visualizing and evaluating rare word embeddings as well as examining sample translations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Effects of Vocabulary Sizes</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, our hybrid models offer large gains of +2.1-11.4 BLEU points over strong word-based systems which already handle unknown words. With only a small vocabulary, e.g., 1000 words, our hybrid approach can produce systems that are better than word-based models that possess much larger vocabularies. While it appears from the plot that gains diminish as we increase the vocabulary size, we argue that our hybrid models are still preferable since they understand word structures and can handle new complex words at test time as illustrated in Section 6.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Rare Word Embeddings</head><p>We evaluate the source character-level model by building representations for rare words and measuring how good these embeddings are.</p><p>Quantitatively, we follow <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Luong et al. (2013)</ref> in using the word similarity task, specifically on the Rare Word dataset, to judge the learned representations for complex words. The evaluation metric is the Spearman's correlation ρ between similarity scores assigned by a model and by human annotators. From the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 3</ref>, we can see that source representations produced by our hy-  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Barnes-Hut-SNE visualization of source word representations -shown are sample words from the Rare Word dataset. We differentiate two types of embeddings: frequent words in which encoder embeddings are looked up directly and rare words where we build representations from characters. Boxes highlight examples that we will discuss in the text. We use the hybrid model (l) in this visualization.</p><p>brid 7 models are significantly better than those of the word-based one. It is noteworthy that our deep recurrent character-level models can outperform the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Luong et al., 2013)</ref>, which uses recursive neural networks and requires a complex morphological analyzer, by a large margin. Our performance is also competitive to the best Glove embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> which were trained on a much larger dataset.</p></div>

For example, in the top-left box, the character-based representations for "loveless", "spiritless", "heartlessly", and "heartlessness" are nearby, but clearly separated into two groups. Similarly, in the center boxes, word-based embeddings of "acceptable", "satisfactory", "unacceptable", and "unsatisfactory", are close by but separated by meanings. Lastly, the remaining boxes demonstrate that our character-level models are able to build representations comparable to the word-based ones, e.g., "impossibilities" vs. "impossible" and "antagonize" vs. "antagonist". All of this evidence strongly supports that the source character-level models are useful and effective.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Sample Translations</head><p>We show in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref> sample translations between various systems. In the first example, our hybrid model translates perfectly. The word-based model fails to translate "diagnosis" because the second &lt;unk&gt; was incorrectly aligned to the word "after". The character-based model, on the other hand, makes a mistake in translating names.  : Sample translations on newstest2015 -for each example, we show the source, human translation, and translations of the following NMT systems: word model (d), char model (g), and hybrid model (k). We show the translations before replacing &lt;unk&gt; tokens (if any) for the word-based and hybrid models. The following formats are used to highlight correct, wrong, and close translation segments.</p><p>For the second example, the hybrid model surprises us when it can capture the long-distance reordering of "fifty years ago" and "pȓed padesáti lety" while the other two models do not. The word-based model translates "Jr." inaccurately due to the incorrect alignment between the second &lt;unk&gt; and the word "said". The characterbased model literally translates the name "King" into "král" which means "king".</p><p>Lastly, both the character-based and hybrid models impress us by their ability to translate compound words exactly, e.g., "11-year-old" and "jedenáctiletá"; whereas the identity copy strategy of the word-based model fails. Of course, our hybrid model does make mistakes, e.g., it fails to translate the name "Shani Bart". Overall, these examples highlight how challenging translating into Czech is and that being able to translate at the character level helps improve the quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We have proposed a novel hybrid architecture that combines the strength of both word-and character-based models. Word-level models are fast to train and offer high-quality translation; whereas, character-level models help achieve the goal of open vocabulary NMT. We have demon-strated these two aspects through our experimental results and translation examples.</p><p>Our best hybrid model has surpassed the performance of both the best word-based NMT system and the best non-neural model to establish a new state-of-the-art result for English-Czech translation in WMT'15 with 20.7 BLEU. Moreover, we have succeeded in replacing the standard unk replacement technique in NMT with our characterlevel components, yielding an improvement of +2.1−11.4 BLEU points. Our analysis has shown that our model has the ability to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, a highly inflected language with an enormous and complex vocabulary, but also build accurate representations for English source words.</p><p>Additionally, we have demonstrated the potential of purely character-based models in producing good translations; they have outperformed past word-level NMT models. For future work, we hope to be able to improve the memory usage and speed of purely character-based models.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head>Table 2 :</head><label>2</label><figDesc></figDesc><table /><note>WMT'15 English-Czech results -shown are the vocabulary sizes, perplexities, BLEU, and chrF 3 scores of various systems on newstest2015.
