{"1017": "the task of learning the causal structure underlying a certain phenomenon is undertaken by connecting the set of conditional independences ( cis) readable from the observational data, on the one side, with the set of corresponding constraints implied over the graphical structure, on the other, which are tied through a graphical criterion known as d-separation ( pearl, 1988) . given a collection of distributions , two causal graphs are called interventionally equivalent if they are associated with the same family of interventional distributions, where the elements of the family are indistinguishable using the invariances obtained from a direct application of the calculus rules. do-constraints have appeared first at the very definition of causal bayesian networks ( cbns) in and then were leveraged to design efficient experiments to learn the causal graph in the context of structure learning. a soft intervention affects the mechanism that generates the variable, while keeping the causal connections intact. soft-interventions are widely employed in biology and medicine, where it is hard to change the underlying system, but possibly 2recall that a ci represents a constraint readable from one specific distribution saying that the value of z is irrelevant for computing the likelihood of y once we know the value of x, i.e., p ( y x, z) p ( y x) , x, y, z. the second observation leveraged here follows from another realization by pearl that interventions can be represented explicitly in the graphical model he then introduced what we call f-nodes, which graphically encode the changes due to an intervention and the corresponding parametrization ( see also 16. this is important in our context since the do-calculus tests will be visible more explicitly in the graph. the graph obtained by adding f-nodes to the causal graph is called the augmented graph. we propose a characterization of i-markov equivalence between two causal graphs with latent variables for a given intervention set i that is based on a generalization of docalculus rules to arbitrary subsets of interventions. we show a graphical characterization of i-markov equivalence of causal graphs with latents. we introduce a learning algorithm for inferring the graphical structure using a combination of observational and interventional data and utilizing the corresponding new constraints. this procedure comes with a new set of orientation rules. we formally show its soundness. one of the most celebrated results in causal inference comes under the rubric of do-calculus ( or causal calculus) 18, the calculus consists of a set of inference rules that allows one to create a map between distributions generated by a causal graph when certain graphical conditions hold in the graph. recent work presented a generalization of this result for soft interventions 4. the calculus was developed in the context of hard interventions, and recent work presented a generalization of this result for soft interventions 4. the first rule of the calculus is a d-separation type of statement relative to a specific interventional distribution px, which says that y z w ind implies the corresponding conditional independence ( yw, z) px ( yw) . note that the converse of this rule is the work horse underlying most of the structure learning algorithms found in practice, which says that if some independence hold in p, this would imply a corresponding graphical separation ( under faithfulness) . in the case just mentioned, this would imply that y and z should be separated ind, meaning, they have neither a directed nor a bidirected arrow connecting them. from this understanding i.e., the converse of the other two rules should offer insights about the underlying graphical conditions. the paper introduces the notion of interventional markov equivalence between two causal graphs. this notion is formalized in the following definition. consider the tuples of absolutely continuous probability distributions ( pi) ii over a set of variables. a tuple ( pi) ii satisfies the i-markov property with respect to a graphd ( vl, e) if the following holds for disjoint y, z, w v: ( 1 for i i: pi ( yw, z) pi ( yw) if y z w ind. ( 2 for i , j i: pi ( yw) pj ( yw) if y z w ind. in order to characterize causal graphs that are i-markov equivalent, we draw some insight from the markov equivalence of causal graphs with latents. ancestral graphs, and more specifically mags, were proposed as a representation to encode the d-separation statements of a causal graph among the measured variables while not explicitly encoding the latent nodes. since all the constraints in the i-markov definition can be tested by d-separation statements in the augmented graph, then an augmented mag preserves all those constraints. fci is an algorithm for learning augmented pags. given an independence model over the measured variables, fci learns the skeleton of the augmented pag. function createaugmentednodes () in alg. creates the f-nodes by computing the set s of unique symmetric difference sets from all pairs of interventions in i sigma () maps every f-node to a source pair of interventions, which is used later on to perform the do-tests. the algorithm starts by creating a complete graph of circle edges between v f then, it removes the edge between any two nodes x and y if a separating set between the pair exists and records the set. we also observe that if two nodes x, y are separated given z in augi ( d) , they are also separated given z f since f are root nodes by construction, i.e., all the edges incident on f-nodes are out of them. algorithm follows a similar flow to that of the fci. the problem of learning the causal structure underlying a phenomenon of interest from a combination of observational and experimental data is investigated. the algorithm is sound, i.e., every adjacency and orientation is common for all mag ( augi) whered is i-markov equivalent tod. we pursue this endeavor by noting that a generalization of pearl s do-calculus leads to new tests that can be evaluated against data. these tests, in turn, translate into constraints over the structure itself. we define an interventional equivalence class based on such criteria, and then derive a graphical characterization for the equivalence of two causal graphs ( thm. finally, we develop an algorithm to learn an interventional equivalence class from data, which includes new orientation rules. we introduce a graphical representation that can be used to determine if two causal graphs are interventionally equivalent. we provide a formal graphical characterization of this equivalence. finally, we extend the fci algorithm, which was originally designed to operate based on cis, to combine observational and interventional datasets, including new orientation rules particular to this setting. a pag, which represents a markov equivalence class of a mag, is learnable from the independence model over the observed variables, and the fci algorithm is a standard sound and complete method to learn such an object related work: learning causal graphs from a combination of observational and interventional data has been studied in the literature 3, 11, 7, 20, 8, 12, for causally sufficient systems, the notion and characterization of interventional markov equivalence has been introduced in 9, more recently, showed that the same characterization can be used for both hard and soft interventions. for causally insufficient systems, uses sat solvers to learn a summary graph over the observed variables given data from different experimental conditions. introduces an algorithm to pool experimental datasets together and runs a modification of fci to learn an augmented graph; however, they do not consider characterizing an equivalence class. given an independence model over the measured variables , fci follows a similar flow to that of fci. in phase i, the algorithm initializes a complete graph with circle edges, then it removes the edge between any pair of nodes if a separating set between the pair exists and records the set. in phase ii, the algorithm identifies unshielded triples a, b, c and orients the edges into b if b is not in the separating set of a and c. finally, in phase iii, fci applies the orientation rules. only one of the rules uses separating sets while the rest use mag properties, and soundness and completeness of the previous phases the skeleton is correct and all the unshielded colliders are discovered.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1002": "###", "1003": "###", "1004": "###", "1005": "###", "1006": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###", "1009": "###", "1010": "###", "1011": "###", "1012": "###", "1013": "###", "1014": "###", "1015": "###", "1016": "###", "1018": "###", "1019": "###", "1020": "###", "1021": "###"}
