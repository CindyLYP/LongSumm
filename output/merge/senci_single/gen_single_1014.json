{"1014": "recommender systems aim to present items with high utility to the consumers utility may be decomposed into form utility: the item is desired as it is manifested, and time utility: the item is desired at the given point in time 28; recommender systems should take both types of utility into account. for an item by comparing the time t since her most recent purchase within the item with the most recent purchase within the category and the item s underlying inter- duration d; larger value of d t may indicate that the item needs to be replaced, and she may be open to related recommendations. in contrast, larger value of d t may indicate that the item needs to be replaced, and she may be open to related recommendations. in this paper, we consider the problem of learning the time durations of items in the same category. the problem of learning a third- or fourth- order tensor x is to find a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) and its frontal slice is a low - rank tensor x such that its frontal slice is a second- or third - order tensor ( matrix) this paper proposes a novel proximal gradient descent algorithm for nuclear norm minimization , where each gradient is approximately computed and the approximation error is upper bounded by a constant between zero and one. since each iteration of proximal gradient descent for nuclear norm minimization only requires a fixed number of iterations of randomized svd ( or equivalently, power iterations) using the warm start strategy, thus we have the following lemma. a proximal gradient descent algorithm can be applied to solve problem ( 6) within o ( nk2t mk2t p0k) time, where t is the number of iterations. the goal of this paper is to propose a demand-aware recommender for one-sided sampling ( daross for short) that is suitable for general e-, item recommendation mechanisms involving both durable and non durable goods. in order to generate the subsets, we randomly sample item categories for tmall dataset and select the users who have purchased at least items within these categories, leading to the purchase records of users and items. for each user pair ( u, i, t) in the test set, we randomly sample her purchase records as the training data, and use the remaining as the test data. for each purchase record ( u, i, t) in the test set, we evaluate all the algorithms on two tasks: ( i) category prediction, and ( ii) purchase time prediction, respectively. the algorithms m3f, pmf, and wr-mf are excluded from the purchase time prediction task since they are static models that do not consider time information. indeed, the learned inter-unlabeled nature of the data can also play an important role in applications more advanced than recommender systems, such as inventory management, operations management, and sales/ marketing management. we formulate it as a tensor norm minimization problem that seeks to jointly learn the form utility tensor and a vector of inter-purchase durations, and propose a scalable algorithm with a tractable time complexity. on two real-world datasets, tmall and amazon review, we show that our algorithm outperforms six state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms on the tasks of category, item, and purchase time predictions. in this paper, we study the problem of demand-aware recommendation. given a user s intention for an item by comparing the time utility since her most recent purchase within the item category cj until time k, the larger the value of d t, the less likely she needs this item. in contrast, the function h max ( 0, d t) may be employed to measure the underlying inter-purchase duration times of the r item categories. it is understood that the inter-purchase durations for nondurable good categories are large, while for durable good categories the inherent properties are small, or even zero. thus, a user might not purchase an item because she does not derive utility from it, or just because she was simply unaware of it or plans to buy it in the future. in this sense, the demand is mediated by the time utility since the last last purchase within item category cj until time k. if user i has not purchased within item category cj until time k, the larger the value of d t, the less likely she needs this item. in this paper , we propose a demand-aware recommendation algorithm for one -sided data. the proposed algorithm is based on a sparse matrix and a sparse matrix with low rank. the sparse matrix is constructed from the frontal slice of a low rank matrix. in this paper we examine it as a tensor nuclear norm minimization problem that seeks jointly learn form utility tensor and a vector of inter-purchase durations, and propose a scalable optimization algorithm with a tractable time complexity. our empirical studies show that the proposed approach can yield perfect recovery of duration vectors in noiseless settings; it is robust to noise and scalable as analyzed theoretically.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1002": "###", "1003": "###", "1004": "###", "1005": "###", "1006": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###", "1009": "###", "1010": "###", "1011": "###", "1012": "###", "1013": "###", "1015": "###", "1016": "###", "1017": "###", "1018": "###", "1019": "###", "1020": "###", "1021": "###"}
