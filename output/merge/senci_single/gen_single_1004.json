{"1004": "in this paper, we show that, in addition to text based turn features, dialogue features can significantly improve detection of emotions in social media customer service dialogues and help predict emotional techniques used by customer service agents. the analysis of emotions in customer support conversations can take two applications: ( 1) to discern and compute quality of service indicators and ( 2) to provide real-time clues to customer service agents regarding the cus-us.pdf tomer emotion expressed in a conversation. a possible application here is recommending to customer service agents what should be their emotional response ( for example, in each situation, should they apologize, should they thank the customer, etc.) to automatically detect emotions being expressed and, second that it is possible to predict the emotional technique that is likely to be used by a human agent in a given situation. this analysis reflects our ultimate goal: to enable a computer system to discern the emotions expressed by human customers, and to develop computerized tools that mimic the emotional technique used by a human customer service agent in a particular situation. we see the main contributions of this paper as follows: ( 1) to our knowledge, this is the first research focusing on automatic analysis of emotions expressed in customer service provided through social media. ( 2) this is the first research using unique dialogue features (e.g. , emotions expressed in previous dialogue turns by the agent and customer , time between dialogue turns) to improve emotion detection. ( 3) this is the first research studying the prediction of the agent emotional technique to be used in the response to customer turns. this paper proposes a novel method for emotion classification in written dialogues. the first objective of our work is to detect emotions expressed in customer turns and the second is to predict the emotional technique in agent turns. while both classifiers work at the level of turns, i.e., classify the current turn to emotions ex- pressed in it, they are inherently different. when detecting emotions in customer turns, the turn s content is available at classification time ( as well as the history of the dialogue) - meaning, the system must now understand what is the emotion expressed. examples of emotions being expressed are not available during classification time, but only the agent action and the history of the dialogue since the agent did not respond yet. this difference stems from the fact that in order to train an automated service agent to respond, the agent based on customer s emotional technique needs to be computed before the agent generates its response sentence. the goal of this paper is to classify agent and customer turn(s) in social media. the paper is divided into two parts. in the first part, the paper is divided into two parts. the goal of this paper is to classify dialogue acts by using a kth-order hidden markov model ( svm-hmm) and conditional random fields (cfd) classifiers. the svm-hmm classifier generates models that are isomorphic to a kth-order hidden markov model. under this model, dependency in past classification results is captured internally by modeling transition probabilities between emotion states. since emotions expressed in customer and agent turns are different, we treated them as different classification tasks ( like in our previous approach) and trained a separate classifier for each emotion. for turn ti, we considered it to express emotion e if tag ( e, ti) where tag ( e, t) is the average judges t tag value of e in t. this process generated the class sizes detailed in table dialogue topic tagging was converted to binary features representing the top-2 selected topics. the temporal response time values were translated to low/medium/high categorical values according to their relation to the 33-th and 66th percentiles. the taxonomy is based on ( zomer and voss, 2010) this paper proposes two classification tasks and two dialogue models that predict the emotional technique used by the support service agent. first tested the classification results for all possible history sizes ( given that that that maximum dialogue size in our dataset is 8) and evaluated them as detailed above. we used the context of the dialogue to extract informative features that we refer to as dialogue features. using these features for emotion classification in written dialogues is novel, and as our experimental results show, it improves performance compared to a model based only on features extracted from the turn s text. we treated these two objectives as two classification tasks. a feature can be global, namely its value is constant across an entire dialogue or it can be a local, meaning that its value may change at each turn. each turn ti is a tuple consisting of turn number, timestamp, content where turn number represents the sequential position of the turn in the dialogue, and content is the textual message. the goal of this paper is to predict the agent turn emotion and the customer turn emotion. the paper proposes two models for predicting the agent turn emotion and the customer turn emotion. the first model is svm, which is an svm classifier that generates models that are isomorphic to a kth-order hidden markov model. the second model is svm-hmm dialogue model, which is an svm dialogue model that generates models that are isomorphic to a kth-order hidden markov model. for predicting the agent turn emotion, the svm dialogue model obtained slightly better results than svm-hmm dialogue model, and reached a macro and micro average f1-score improvements over all dialogues of and 43.5, respectively. these results emphasize the differences between the svm dialogue and svm-hmm dialogue models. for customer turn emotion detection, the svm-hmm dialogue model performed better than the svm dialogue model, and reached a macro and micro average f1-score improvements over all dialogues of and 11.7, respectively.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1002": "###", "1003": "###", "1005": "###", "1006": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###", "1009": "###", "1010": "###", "1011": "###", "1012": "###", "1013": "###", "1014": "###", "1015": "###", "1016": "###", "1017": "###", "1018": "###", "1019": "###", "1020": "###", "1021": "###"}
