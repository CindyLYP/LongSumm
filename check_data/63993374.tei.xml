				<p>We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many problems in image processing, computer graphics, and computer vision can be posed as “translating” an input image into a corresponding output image. Just as a concept may be expressed in either English or French, a scene may be rendered as an RGB image, a gradient field, an edge map, a semantic label map, etc. In analogy to automatic language translation, we define automatic image-to-image translation as the problem of translating one possible representation of a scene into another, given sufficient training data (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. One reason language translation is difficult is because the mapping between languages is rarely one-to-one -any given concept is easier to express in one language than another. Similarly, most image-to-image translation problems are either many-to-one (computer vision) -mapping photographs to edges, segments, or semantic labels, or one-to-many (computer graphics) -mapping labels or sparse user inputs to realistic images. Traditionally, each of these tasks has been tackled with separate, special-purpose machinery (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>), despite the fact that the setting is always the same: predict pixels from pixels. Our goal in this paper is to develop a common framework for all these problems.</p><p>The community has already taken significant steps in this direction, with convolutional neural nets (CNNs) becoming the common workhorse behind a wide variety of image prediction problems. CNNs learn to minimize a loss functionan objective that scores the quality of results -and although the learning process is automatic, a lot of manual effort still goes into designing effective losses. In other words, we still have to tell the CNN what we wish it to minimize. But, just like Midas, we must be careful what we wish for! If we take a naive approach, and ask the CNN to minimize Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth pixels, it will tend to produce blurry results <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>. This is because Euclidean distance is minimized by averaging all plausible outputs, which causes blurring. Coming up with loss functions that force the CNN to do what we really want -e.g., output sharp, realistic images -is an open problem and generally requires expert knowledge.</p><p>It would be highly desirable if we could instead specify only a high-level goal, like "make the output indistinguishable from reality", and then automatically learn a loss function appropriate for satisfying this goal. Fortunately, this is exactly what is done by the recently proposed Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47]</ref>. GANs learn a loss that tries to classify if the output image is real or fake, while simultaneously training a generative model to minimize this loss. Blurry images will not be tolerated since they look obviously fake. Because GANs learn a loss that adapts to the data, they can be applied to a multitude of tasks that traditionally would require very different kinds of loss functions.</p><p>In this paper, we explore GANs in the conditional setting. Just as GANs learn a generative model of data, conditional GANs (cGANs) learn a conditional generative model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. This makes cGANs suitable for image-to-image translation tasks, where we condition on an input image and generate a corresponding output image.</p><p>GANs have been vigorously studied in the last two years and many of the techniques we explore in this paper have been previously proposed. Nonetheless, earlier papers have focused on specific applications, and it has remained unclear how effective image-conditional GANs can be as a general-purpose solution for image-toimage translation. Our primary contribution is to demonstrate that on a wide variety of problems, conditional GANs produce reasonable results. Our second contribution is to present a simple framework sufficient to achieve good results, and to analyze the effects of several important architectural choices. Code is available at https://github.com/phillipi/pix2pix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Related work</head><p>Structured losses for image modeling Image-to-image translation problems are often formulated as per-pixel clas-sification or regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref>. These formulations treat the output space as "unstructured" in the sense that each output pixel is considered conditionally independent from all others given the input image. Conditional GANs instead learn a structured loss. Structured losses penalize the joint configuration of the output. A large body of literature has considered losses of this kind, with popular methods including conditional random fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the SSIM metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, feature matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, nonparametric losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>, the convolutional pseudo-prior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, and losses based on matching covariance statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref>. Our conditional GAN is different in that the loss is learned, and can, in theory, penalize any possible structure that differs between output and target.</p><p>Conditional GANs We are not the first to apply GANs in the conditional setting. Previous works have conditioned GANs on discrete labels <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, text <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref>, and, indeed, images. The image-conditional models have tackled inpainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>, image prediction from a normal map <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, image manipulation guided by user constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>, future frame prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>, future state prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, product photo generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref>, and style transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>. Each of these methods was tailored for a specific application. Our framework differs in that nothing is application-specific. This makes our setup considerably simpler than most others.</p><p>Our method also differs from these prior works in several architectural choices for the generator and discriminator. Unlike past work, for our generator we use a "U-Net"based architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, and for our discriminator we use a convolutional "PatchGAN" classifier, which only penalizes structure at the scale of image patches. A similar Patch-GAN architecture was previously proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, for the purpose of capturing local style statistics. Here we show that this approach is effective on a wider range of problems, and we investigate the effect of changing the patch size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>GANs are generative models that learn a mapping from random noise vector z to output image y: G : z → y <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In contrast, conditional GANs learn a mapping from observed image x and random noise vector z, to y: G : {x, z} → y. The generator G is trained to produce outputs that cannot be distinguished from "real" images by an adversarially trained discrimintor, D, which is trained to do as well as possible at detecting the generator's "fakes". This training procedure is diagrammed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Objective</head><p>The objective of a conditional GAN can be expressed as  where G tries to minimize this objective against an adversarial D that tries to maximize it, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L cGAN (G, D) =E x,y∼p data (x,y) [log D(x, y)]+ E x∼p data (x),z∼pz(z) [log(1 − D(x, G(x, z))],<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">G * = arg min G max D L cGAN (G, D).</formula><p>To test the importance of conditioning the discrimintor, we also compare to an unconditional variant in which the discriminator does not observe x:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">L GAN (G, D) =E y∼p data (y) [log D(y)]+ E x∼p data (x),z∼pz(z) [log(1 − D(G(x, z))].<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Previous approaches to conditional GANs have found it beneficial to mix the GAN objective with a more traditional loss, such as L2 distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. The discriminator's job remains unchanged, but the generator is tasked to not only fool the discriminator but also to be near the ground truth output in an L2 sense. We also explore this option, using L1 distance rather than L2 as L1 encourages less blurring:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L L1 (G) = E x,y∼p data (x,y),z∼pz(z) [ y − G(x, z) 1 ]. (3)</formula><p>Our final objective is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">G * = arg min G max D L cGAN (G, D) + λL L1 (G).<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Without z, the net could still learn a mapping from x to y, but would produce deterministic outputs, and therefore fail to match any distribution other than a delta function. Past conditional GANs have acknowledged this and provided Gaussian noise z as an input to the generator, in addition to x (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>). In initial experiments, we did not find Encoder-decoder U-Net <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Two choices for the architecture of the generator. The "U-Net" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> is an encoder-decoder with skip connections between mirrored layers in the encoder and decoder stacks.</p><p>this strategy effective -the generator simply learned to ignore the noise -which is consistent with Mathieu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Instead, for our final models, we provide noise only in the form of dropout, applied on several layers of our generator at both training and test time. Despite the dropout noise, we observe very minor stochasticity in the output of our nets. Designing conditional GANs that produce stochastic output, and thereby capture the full entropy of the conditional distributions they model, is an important question left open by the present work.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Network architectures</head><p>We adapt our generator and discriminator architectures from those in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>. Both generator and discriminator use modules of the form convolution-BatchNorm-ReLu <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>. Details of the architecture are provided in the appendix, with key features discussed below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Generator with skips</head><p>A defining feature of image-to-image translation problems is that they map a high resolution input grid to a high resolution output grid. In addition, for the problems we consider, the input and output differ in surface appearance, but both are renderings of the same underlying structure. Therefore, structure in the input is roughly aligned with structure in the output. We design the generator architecture around these considerations.</p><p>Many previous solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43]</ref> to problems in this area have used an encoder-decoder network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>. In such a network, the input is passed through a series of layers that progressively downsample, until a bottleneck layer, at which point the process is reversed <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Such a network requires that all information flow pass through all the layers, including the bottleneck. For many image translation problems, there is a great deal of low-level information shared between the input and output, and it would be desirable to shuttle this information directly across the net. For example, in the case of image colorizaton, the input and output share the location of prominent edges.</p><p>To give the generator a means to circumvent the bottleneck for information like this, we add skip connections, following the general shape of a "U-Net" <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>  <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>). Specifically, we add skip connections between each layer i and layer n − i, where n is the total number of layers. Each skip connection simply concatenates all channels at layer i with those at layer n − i.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Markovian discriminator (PatchGAN)</head><p>It is well known that the L2 loss -and L1, see <ref type="figure">Figure</ref> 4 -produces blurry results on image generation problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref>. Although these losses fail to encourage highfrequency crispness, in many cases they nonetheless accurately capture the low frequencies. For problems where this is the case, we do not need an entirely new framework to enforce correctness at the low frequencies. L1 will already do.</p><p>This motivates restricting the GAN discriminator to only model high-frequency structure, relying on an L1 term to force low-frequency correctness (Eqn. 4). In order to model high-frequencies, it is sufficient to restrict our attention to the structure in local image patches. Therefore, we design a discriminator architecture -which we term a PatchGAN -that only penalizes structure at the scale of patches. This discriminator tries to classify if each N × N patch in an image is real or fake. We run this discriminator convolutationally across the image, averaging all responses to provide the ultimate output of D.</p><p>In Section 3.4, we demonstrate that N can be much smaller than the full size of the image and still produce high quality results. This is advantageous because a smaller PatchGAN has fewer parameters, runs faster, and can be applied on arbitrarily large images.</p><p>Such a discriminator effectively models the image as a Markov random field, assuming independence between pixels separated by more than a patch diameter. This connection was previously explored in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>, and is also the common assumption in models of texture <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> and style <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24]</ref>. Our PatchGAN can therefore be understood as a form of texture/style loss.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Optimization and inference</head><p>To optimize our networks, we follow the standard approach from <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>: we alternate between one gradient descent step on D, then one step on G. We use minibatch SGD and apply the Adam solver <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</p><p>At inference time, we run the generator net in exactly the same manner as during the training phase. This differs from the usual protocol in that we apply dropout at test time, and we apply batch normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref> using the statistics of the test batch, rather than aggregated statistics of the training batch. This approach to batch normalization, when the batch size is set to 1, has been termed "instance normalization" and has been demonstrated to be effective at image generation tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>. In our experiments, we use batch size 1 for certain experiments and 4 for others, noting little difference between these two conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiments</head><p>To explore the generality of conditional GANs, we test the method on a variety of tasks and datasets, including both graphics tasks, like photo generation, and vision tasks, like semantic segmentation:</p><p>• Semantic labels↔photo, trained on the Cityscapes dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. • Architectural labels→photo, trained on the CMP Facades dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>. • Map↔aerial photo, trained on data scraped from Google Maps. • BW→color photos, trained on <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</p><p>• Edges→photo, trained on data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>; binary edges generated using the HED edge detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> plus postprocessing. Data requirements and speed We note that decent results can often be obtained even on small datasets. Our facade training set consists of just 400 images (see results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref>), and the day to night training set consists of only 91 unique webcams (see results in <ref type="figure">Figure 13</ref>). On datasets of this size, training can be very fast: for example, the results shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 12</ref> took less than two hours of training on a single Pascal Titan X GPU. At test time, all models run in well under a second on this GPU.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Evaluation metrics</head><p>Evaluating the quality of synthesized images is an open and difficult problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Traditional metrics such as perpixel mean-squared error do not assess joint statistics of the result, and therefore do not measure the very structure that structured losses aim to capture.</p><p>In order to more holistically evaluate the visual quality of our results, we employ two tactics. First, we run  "real vs fake" perceptual studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). For graphics problems like colorization and photo generation, plausibility to a human observer is often the ultimate goal. Therefore, we test our map generation, aerial photo generation, and image colorization using this approach.</p><p>Second, we measure whether or not our synthesized cityscapes are realistic enough that off-the-shelf recognition system can recognize the objects in them. This metric is similar to the "inception score" from <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>, the object detection evaluation in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, and the "semantic interpretability" measure in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>.</p><p>AMT perceptual studies For our AMT experiments, we followed the protocol from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>: Turkers were presented with a series of trials that pitted a "real" image against a "fake" image generated by our algorithm. On each trial, each image appeared for 1 second, after which the images disappeared and Turkers were given unlimited time to respond as to which was fake. The first 10 images of each session were practice and Turkers were given feedback. No feedback was provided on the 40 trials of the main experiment. Each session tested just one algorithm at a time, and Turkers were not allowed to complete more than one session. ∼ 50 Turkers evaluated each algorithm. All images were presented at 256 × 256 resolution. Unlike <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref>, we did not include vigilance trials. For our colorization experiments, the real and fake images were generated from the same grayscale input. For map↔aerial photo, the real and fake images were not generated from the same input, in order to make the task more difficult and avoid floor-level results.</p><p>FCN-score While quantitative evaluation of generative models is known to be challenging, recent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46]</ref> have tried using pre-trained semantic classifiers to measure the discriminability of the generated images as a pseudo-metric. The intuition is that if the generated images are realistic, classifiers trained on real images will be able to classify the synthesized image correctly as well. To this end, we adopt the popular FCN-8s <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref> architecture for semantic segmentation, and train it on the cityscapes dataset. We then score synthesized photos by the classification accuracy against the labels these photos were synthesized from.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Analysis of the objective function</head><p>Which components of the objective in Eqn. 4 are important? We run ablation studies to isolate the effect of the L1 term, the GAN term, and to compare using a discriminator conditioned on the input (cGAN, Eqn. 1) against using an unconditional discriminator (GAN, Eqn. 2). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the qualitative effects of these variations on two labels→photo problems. L1 alone leads to reasonable but blurry results. The cGAN alone (setting λ = 0 in Eqn. 4) gives much sharper results, but results in some artifacts in facade synthesis. Adding both terms together (with λ = 100) reduces these artifacts.</p><p>We quantify these observations using the FCN-score on the cityscapes labels→photo task <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref>: the GAN-based objectives achieve higher scores, indicating that the synthesized images include more recognizable structure. We also test the effect of removing conditioning from the discriminator (labeled as GAN). In this case, the loss does not penalize mismatch between the input and output; it only cares that the output look realistic. This variant results in very poor performance; examining the results reveals that the generator collapsed into producing nearly the exact same output regardless of input photograph. Clearly it is important, in this case, that the loss measure the quality of the match between input and output, and indeed cGAN performs much better than GAN. Note, however, that adding an L1 term also encourages that the output respect the input, since the L1 loss penalizes the distance between ground truth outputs, which match the input, and synthesized outputs, which may not. Correspondingly, L1+GAN is also effective at creating realistic renderings that respect the in- </p></div>

Uncertainty in the output manifests itself differently for different loss functions. Uncertain regions become blurry and desaturated under L1. The 1x1 PixelGAN encourages greater color diversity but has no effect on spatial statistics. The 16x16 PatchGAN creates locally sharp results, but also leads to tiling artifacts beyond the scale it can observe. The 70x70 PatchGAN forces outputs that are sharp, even if incorrect, in both the spatial and spectral (coforfulness) dimensions. The full 256x256 ImageGAN produces results that are visually similar to the 70x70 PatchGAN, but somewhat lower quality according to our FCN-score metric <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2)</ref>. Please see https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/ for additional examples.</p><p>put label maps. Combining all terms, L1+cGAN, performs similarly well.</p><p>Colorfulness A striking effect of conditional GANs is that they produce sharp images, hallucinating spatial structure even where it does not exist in the input label map. One might imagine cGANs have a similar effect on "sharpening" in the spectral dimension -i.e. making images more colorful. Just as L1 will incentivize a blur when it is uncertain where exactly to locate an edge, it will also incentivize an average, grayish color when it is uncertain which of several plausible color values a pixel should take on. Specially, L1 will be minimized by choosing the median of of the conditional probability density function over possible colors. An adversarial loss, on the other hand, can in principle become aware that grayish outputs are unrealistic, and encourage matching the true color distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, we investigate if our cGANs actually achieve this effect on the Cityscapes dataset. The plots show the marginal distri-butions over output color values in Lab color space. The ground truth distributions are shown with a dotted line. It is apparent that L1 leads to a narrower distribution than the ground truth, confirming the hypothesis that L1 encourages average, grayish colors.

Does this lead to better results? <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref> compares the U-Net against an encoder-decoder on cityscape generation U-Net. The encoder-decoder is created simply by severing the skip connections in the U-Net. The encoder-decoder is unable to learn to generate realistic images in our experiments, and indeed collapses to producing nearly identical results for each input label map. The advantages of the U-Net appear not to be specific to conditional GANs: when both U-Net and encoder-decoder are trained   <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> of the original GAN paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>).

For example, the bus in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> is painted gray when the net is trained with an L1 loss, but becomes red with the PixelGAN loss.

The × 70 Patch-GAN alleviates these artifacts. Scaling beyond this, to the full 256 × 256 ImageGAN, does not appear to improve the visual quality of the results, and in fact gets a considerably lower FCN-score <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 2</ref>).

In contrast, in the photo→map directionm our method only fooled participants on 6.1% of trials, and this was not significantly different than the performance of the L1 baseline (based on bootstrap test).
