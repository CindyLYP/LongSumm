benchmark, or, in order to obtain a generic representation, any external corpus, e.g., wikipedia, may be used. the network can naturally handle unseen words, since it predicts vectors in the word vector space rather than a specific word. in order to obtain a fixed size representation, a network can not handle a sentence containing a word that does not appear in its training data. when training the rnn, the same 300d fullyconnected layer is used, followed by an lstm layer of size the output layer. the early stopping point is chosen at the epoch with highest recognition accuracy on the

using different activation patterns, and that global max-pooling induces behavior which separates important ngrams from the rest. finally, we show practical use cases derived from our findings in the

clustering the activated ngrams according to their slot activation patterns and showing the top-k in each clusters, we get a much more refined coverage of the linguistic patterns that are captured by the filter. we also show that filters sometimes opt to assign negative values to certain word activations in order to cause the ngrams which contain them to receive a low score despite having otherwise highly activating words. for example, table shows an ngram pattern for which slot contains determiners and other filler tokens such as hyphens, periods and commas with relatively weak slot

demonstrates a 7.5x improvement on mean reciprocal rank over the state-of-the - art. the aim of this paper is to improve the accuracy of chinese word encodings by using a learning model based on the phonetic similarity between the initial and final words. the model aims to minimize the sum of the absolute differences between the euclidean distances of component pairs and the average distances obtained from the annotated training data across all pairs for initials ( or finals) we also incorporate a penalty function, p, for pairs deviating from the manually annotated distance so that more phonetically similar pairs are penalized more highly. the final goal is to map each initial ( or final) to an ndimensional point. we ask two native chinese speakers to annotate the quality of the generated candidates. since downstream applications will only consider a limited number of candidates in practice, we evaluate precision via a manual annotation task on the top-ranked spelling candidates generated by each approach. we observe that the predefined clusters are not well aligned, and many clusters are mixed together, preventing dimsim from considering variations within a cluster to be more similar than variations between clusters. phonetic transcription is a widely observed phenomenon in chinese social media and informal language. dimsim generates phonetically similar candidate words based on learned encodings that capture the pronunciation characteristics of pinyin initial, final, and tone components. using a real world dataset, we demonstrate that dimsim

systems. cipitr is an end - to - end program induction engine that generates a natural language query and generates an output program in a number of steps. a program is composed of actions, which are operators applied over variables. a program is composed of actions, which are operators applied over variables, cipitr uses a beam search to obtain multiple candidate programs to provide feedback to the model from a single training instance. in the second phase ( algorithm phase) the model is allowed to operate on all the generated variables in order to reach the answer. the programmer learns whether to switch from the first phase to the second at any timestep t, based on parameter t1 indicating change of phase, where 0 is obtained as t 1max and iyyer et al. hams, proposed by parr and russell, is one such important form of abstraction aimed at restricting the realizable action sequences. cipitr uses auxiliary rewarding techniques to mitigate the extreme reward sparsity and incorporates generic pragmatic programming styles to constrain the combinatorial program space to only semantically correct programs. as future reward styles sparsity, cipitr can be further improved to handle the hardest question types by making the search more strategic. as future reward styles sparsity, cipitr can be further improved to handle the hardest question types by making the search

this end, dual-ces tries to handle the tradeoff by gradually shifting from generating a long summary that is more salient in the first step to generating a short summary that is more focused in the second step. moreover, dualces utilizes the long summary that was generated in the first step for saliency-based pseudo-feedback distillation, which allows to generate a final focused summary with better saliency. in this paper, the ce-method is used to produce a 250-word ( lmax 250) topic-focused summary. here, the ce-method is used to produce a 250-word ( lmax 250) topic-focused summary. in

real-time on a standard cpu. the modular setup of the system allows for simple adaptation to new voices with a small amount of data. the system is composed of three separate neural network blocks prosody prediction, acoustic feature prediction and linear prediction coding net as a neural vocoder. the lpcnet decoder is a wavernn variant that uses a nn model to generate speech samples from equidistant-intime input of cepstrum, pitch and pitch correlation parameters. the lpcnet uses its nn to predict the lpc residual ( the vocal source signal) and then apply to it an lpc filter calculated from the cepstrum. this has the advantages of better control over the output of the spectral shape since it depends directly on the lpc filter shape. the system is modular and provides easy control, flexibility and adaptability at the component level. hence, the system is modular and provides easy control, flexibility and adaptability at the component level. the tests were performed using the amazon mechanical turk ( amt) platform with 50- anonymous and untrained subjects participating in several evaluation sessions, constructed so that each sentence is evaluated by distinct subjects. in this article we present a new tts system that produces high quality speech while operating at faster than real-time rate without an expensive gpu support. the system is built around three nn models for generating the prosody, acoustic features and the final speech signal. we tested this system using two proprietary tts voice datasets and demonstrated that our system produces high quality speech that is comparable to larger and much slower tacotron2 wavenet systems. the task of creating a high-quality tts system out of a smaller set of audio data is even more challenging. we have shown that our system can perform well even with datasets as small as 5-20 minutes of audio data."}, {"id": 1021, "pred": "feature selection is an important problem in statistics and machine
