{"1016": "we introduce a stereo correspondence system implemented fully on event-based digital hardware, using a fully graph-based non von-neumann computation model, where no frames , arrays, or any other such data-structures are used. this is the first time that an end-to-end stereo pipeline from image acquisition and rectification , multiscale spatiotemporal stereo correspondence, winner-take-all, to disparity regularization is implemented fully on event-based hardware. using a cluster of truenorth neurosynaptic processors, we demonstrate their ability to process bilateral event-based inputs streamed live by dynamic vision sensors ( dvs) , at up to 2,000 disparity maps per second, producing high fidelity disparities which are in turn used to reconstruct , at low power, the depth of events produced from rapidly changing scenes. the speed and low power requirements of these applications can be effectively met using event-based sensors. event-based stereo provides additional advantages over other depth estimation methods that increase accuracy and save energy, such as high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and robustness to interference with other agents. this paper proposes a new event - based disparity method that uses a pair of synchronized davis sensors and nine truenorth ns1e boards. the proposed event - based disparity method is implemented using a stereo pair of davis sensors and nine truenorth ns1e boards however, the method is applicable to other spiking neuromorphic architectures, and it is also tested offline on larger models using a truenorth simulator. input rectification , spatiotemporal scaling , feature matching, search for best matches, morphological erosion and dilation, and bidirectional consistency check are all performed on truenorth, for a fully neuromorphic disparity solution. with respect to the most relevant state-of-the-art 17, our method uses less power per pixel per disparity map. we also release the event-based stereo dataset used, which includes kinect-based registered ground-truth. truenorth is a neuromorphic event - based event - based neural network architecture that is designed to address the needs of neuromorphic event - based neural networks for tasks such as pattern recognition and pattern recognition. truenorth is a hierarchical , compositional , object - oriented language the proposed local event - based stereo correspondence algorithm is implemented end-to-end as a neuromorphic event - based algorithm. this consists of systems of equations defining the behavior of truenorth neurons, encased in modules called corelets 1, and the subsequent composition of the inputs and outputs of these modules. depicts the sequence of operations performed by the corelets using inputs from stereo event sensors. the stereo rectification is defined by a pair of functions l , r which map each pixel in the left and right sensor rectified space to a w. on a w splitter neurons per sensor polarity channel, arranged in an optional h. the events at each rectified pixel p h l, r, , , are generated through splitter neurons which replicate corresponding sensor pixels. the ring buffer is implemented by storing events in membrane potentials of memory cell neurons in a circular buffer, and through the use of control neurons which spike periodically to polarize appropriate memory cell neurons. buffers can encode the input at various temporal scales. in this paper we present a novel approach to denoise binary input images from a neural network . the neural network is modeled as a ring - buffer with memory cells , where probe pulses periodically and uniformly query the memory cells for the stored memory contents at each tick, where m neurons are probed at odd ticks and m neurons are probed at even ticks. reset pulses control when to reset one of the t memory cells to zero in preparation of a new input. the probe pulses result in the creation of an output event if during the last tick. after probe event, a reset event decrements the previous membrane potential increase, followed by the restoring of the memory event output during the last probe ( a2 ( v mem p, m, r (t) ) 0, 1k and fr ( v mem p, m, r (t) 0, 1k ) the hadamard product is calculated in parallel across multiple neurons, as k pairwise logical and operations of corresponding feature vector entries, resulting in v dot p, q, k, k. for a set of qt-coded inputs, the wta system is realized by a cascade of ( b1 ) feed-forward pruning networks where each of the pruning networks process only 3-bits of the qt codes and prune the inputs not equal to the bitwise maximum of corresonding 3-bits thermometer codes from all inputs. now starting from the most significant bits, all the inputs smaller than the maximum will be pruned at different stages and only the winner ( s) will survive at the output of the last cascade network. this paper describes the use of a sparse event based stereo camera for estimating 3d structures from images captured using a fast rotating fan and a rotating toy butterfly. we present a fully event based neuromorphic stereo system capable of running on live input event streams, using a fully graph-based computation model, where no frames, arrays or other such data-structures are used. the implemented neuromorphic stereo disparity system achieves these advantages, while consuming less power per pixel per disparity map compared to the stateof-the-art the homogeneous computational substrate provides the first example of a fully end-to-end low-power, high throughput fully event-based neuromorphic stereo system capable of running on live input event streams, using a fully graph-based computation model, where no frames, arrays or other such data-structures are used. experiments on real-world sequences demonstrate the ability of the system to take full advantage of the asynchronous and sparse nature of dvs sensors for low power depth reconstruction, in environments where conventional frame-based cameras connected to synchronous processors would be inefficient for rapidly moving objects. the winner-take-all ( wta) system is a feed - forward neural network that takes as input d code representations of the hadamard products for d distinct candidate disparity levels, and finds the disparity with the largest value, at every tick. for designing a scalable and compact wta system on a neuromorphic hardware, we introduced a novel encoding technique for inputs. in a binary eventbased system, numbers can be efficiently coded using base4 representation where each digit is encoded using a 3-bits thermometer code. note that a thermometer code of length 2n bits can be represented by a qtc of length n/2 bits. while it takes a few more bits than a binary representation, it allows designing a feed-forward subnetworks, compared to eight for a binary representation. latency is further improved with larger bases, but the growth in thermometer code length results in consuming more hardware resources.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1002": "###", "1003": "###", "1004": "###", "1005": "###", "1006": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###", "1009": "###", "1010": "###", "1011": "###", "1012": "###", "1013": "###", "1014": "###", "1015": "###", "1017": "###", "1018": "###", "1019": "###", "1020": "###", "1021": "###"}
