they consider the problem of finding a feature selection function that is sparse on the support of its gradient. this is achieved by introducing a nonlinear sparsity penalty called the sparsity penalty. the sparsity penalty is defined as follows: 0(f) je(x, y) s(x, y) s(x, y) s(x, y) s(x, y) s(x, y) s(x this paper introduces a new sic objective, called sic(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)(x, y)( this paper proposes to learn the feature map as a deep neural network. the key idea of the paper is that the feature map can be used as a measure of the dependency between the input and the output of the network. the key idea of the paper is that the feature map can be used as a measure of the dependency between the input and the output of the network. this is desirable since it allows for an interpretable model, similar to the effect of lasso with linear models, our sparsity inducing gradient penalties result in a nonlinear selfexplainable witness function f 23, with explicit sparse dependency on the inputs. this paper proposes a method to control false discovery rates (fdr) in feature selection algorithms. in particular, the authors propose a method to control the false discovery rate (fdr) in feature selection algorithms. in a nutshell, for a feature selection problem given the ground truth set of features, and a feature selection method such as sic that gives a candidate set s, our goal is to maximize the tpr (true positive rate) or the power, and to keep the fdr under control. tpr and fdr are defined as follows: tpr : e i : s i : this paper introduces a new dependency measure, called the sobolev independence criterion (sic) for feature selection and interpretable decision making. in particular, the value of y only depends on a subset of features, and performance is quantified in terms of tpr and fdr in discovering them among the irrelevant features. given samples from the joint sample, it is easy to see that the empirical convex sic from samples and the marginals, i.e. the difference of sic scores between each feature and its corresponding marginals, gives rise to feature importance which can be used for feature selection and interpretable decision making. in experiments, in this paper, the authors propose a method to train a neural network to predict the score of a witness on the null end of a training set. the key idea is to train a neural network to predict the score of a witness on the null end of a training
