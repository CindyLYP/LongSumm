But predicting the future in many computer vision tasks is inherently riddled with uncertainty (see Fig. 1). Imagine a busy traffic intersection, where such ambiguity is exacerbated by diverse interactions of automobiles, pedestrians and cyclists with each other, as well as with semantic elements such as lanes, crosswalks and traffic lights. Despite tremendous recent interest in future prediction [3, 5, 17, 23, 26, 45, 46], existing state-of-the-art produces outcomes that are either deterministic, or do not fully account for interactions, semantic context or long-term future rewards.\nIn contrast, we present DESIRE, a Deep Stochastic IOC RNN Encoder-decoder framework, to overcome those limitations. The key traits of DESIRE are its ability to simultaneously: (a) generate diverse hypotheses to reflect a distribution over plausible futures, (b) reason about interactions between multiple dynamic objects and the scene context, (c) rank and refine hypotheses with consideration of long-term future rewards (see Fig. 1). These objectives are cast within a deep learning framework.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n04 39\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n4 A\npr 2\n01 7\nWe model the scene as composed of semantic elements (such as roads and crosswalks) and dynamic participants or agents (such as cars and pedestrians). A static or moving observer is also considered as an instance of an agent. We formulate future prediction as determining the locations of agents at various instants in the future, relying solely on observations of the past states of the scene, in the form of agent trajectories and scene context derived from image-based features or other sensory data if available. The problem is posed in an optimization framework that maximizes the potential future reward of the prediction. Specifically, we propose the following novel mechanisms to realize the above advantages, also illustrated in Fig. 2: • Diverse Sample Generation: Sec. 3.1 presents a condi-\ntional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) framework [41] to learn a sampling model that, given observations of past trajectories, produces a diverse set of prediction hypotheses to capture the multimodality of the space of plausible futures. The CVAE introduces a latent variable to account for the ambiguity of the future, which is combined with a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoding of past trajectories, to generate hypotheses using another RNN. • IOC-based Ranking and Refinement: In Sec. 3.2, we propose a ranking module that determines the most likely hypotheses, while incorporating scene context and interactions. Since an optimal policy is hard to determine where multiple agents make strategic inter-dependent choices, the ranking objective is formulated to account for potential future rewards similar to inverse optimal control (IOC). This also ensures generalization to new situations further in the future, given limited training data. The module is trained in a multitask framework with a regression-based refinement of the predicted samples. In the testing phase, we iterate the above multiple times to obtain more accurate refinements of the future prediction. • Scene Context Fusion: Sec. 3.3 presents the Scene Context Fusion (SCF) layer that aggregates interactions between agents and the scene context encoded by a convolutional neural network (CNN). The fused embedding is channeled to the aforementioned RNN scoring module and allows to produce the rewards based on the contextual information.\nWhile DESIRE is a general framework that is applicable to any future prediction task, we demonstrate its utility in two applications – traffic scene understanding for autonomous driving and behavior prediction in aerial surveillance. Sec. 4 demonstrates outstanding accuracy for predicting the future locations of traffic participants in the KITTI raw dataset and pedestrians in the Stanford Drone dataset.\nTo summarize, this paper presents DESIRE, which is a deep learning based stochastic framework for time-profiled distant future prediction, with several attractive properties: • Scalability: The use of deep learning rather than hand-\ncrafted features enables end-to-end training and easy incor-\nporation of multiple cues arising from past motions, scene context and interactions between multiple agents. • Diversity: The stochastic output of a deep generative model (CVAE) is combined with an RNN encoding of past observations to generate multiple prediction hypotheses that hallucinate ambiguities and multimodalities inherent in future prediction. • Accuracy: The IOC-based framework accumulates longterm future rewards for sampled trajectories and the regression-based refinement module learns to estimate a deformation of the trajectory, enabling more accurate predictions further into the future."

      "text" : "Classical methods Path prediction problems have been studied extensively with different approaches such as Kalman filters [18], linear regressions [29] to non-linear Gaussian Process regression models [49, 33, 34, 48], autoregressive models [2] and time-series analysis [32]. Such predictions suffice for scenarios with few interactions between the agent and the scene or other agents (like a flight monitoring system). In contrast, we propose methods for more complex environments such as surveillance for a crowd of pedestrians or traffic intersections, where the locomotion of individual agents is severely influenced by the scene context (e.g., drivable road or building) and the other agents (e.g., people or cars try to avoid colliding with the other). IOC for path prediction Kitani et al. recover human preferences (i.e., reward function) to forecast plausible paths for a pedestrian in [23] using inverse optimal control (IOC), or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) [1, 52], while [26] adapt IOC and propose a dynamic reward function to address changes in environments for sequential path predictions. Combined with a deep neural network, deep IOC/IRL has been proposed to learn non-linear reward functions and showed promising results in robot control [11] and driving [50] tasks. However, one critical assumption made in IOC frameworks, which makes them hard to be applied to general path prediction tasks, is that the goal state or the destination of agent should be given a priori, whereby feasible paths must be found to the given destination from the planning or control point of view. A few approaches relaxed this assumption with so-called goal set [28, 10], but these goals are still limited to a target task space. Furthermore, a recovered cost function using IOC is inherently static, thus it is not suitable for time-profiled prediction tasks. Finally, past approaches do not incorporate interaction between agents, which is often a key constraint to the motion of multiple agents. In contrast, our methods are designed for more natural scenarios where agent goals are open-ended, unknown or time-varying and where agents interact with each other while dynamically adapting in anticipation of future behaviors. Future prediction Walker et al. [47] propose a visual pre-\ndiction framework with a data-driven unsupervised approach, but only on a static scene, while [5] learn scene-specific motion patterns and apply to novel scenes for motion prediction as a knowledge transfer. A method for future localization from egocentric perspective is also addressed successfully in [30]. But unlike our method, none of those can provide time-profiled predictions. Recently, a large dataset is collected in [36] to propose the concept of social sensitivity to improve forecasting models and the multi-target tracking task. However, their social force [14] based model has limited navigation styles represented merely using parameters of distance-based Gaussians.\nInteractions When modeling the behavior of an agent, it should also be taken into account that the dynamics of an agent not only depend on its own, but also on the behavior of others. Predicting the dynamics of multiple objects is also studied in [24, 25, 3, 31], to name a few. Recently, a novel pooling layer is presented by [3], where the hidden state of neighboring pedestrians are shared together to joinly reason across multiple people. Nonetheless, these models lack predictive capacity as they do not take into account scene context. In [24], a dynamic Bayesian network to capture situational awareness is proposed as a context cue for pedestrian path prediction, but the model is limited to orientations and distances of pedestrians to vehicles and the curbside. A large body of work in reinforcement learning, especially game theoretical generalizations of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), addresses multi-agent cases such as minmax-Q learning [27] and Nash-Q learning [16]. However, as noted in [38], typically learning in multi-agent setting is inherently more complex than single agent setting [40, 39, 6].\nRNNs for sequence prediction Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are natural generalizations of feedforward neural networks to sequences [42] and have achieved remarkable results in speech recognition [13], machine translation [4, 42, 7] and image captioning [19, 51, 9]. The power of RNNs for sequence-to-sequence modeling thus makes them a reasonable model of choice to learn to generate sequential future prediction outputs. Our approach is similar to [7] in making use of the encoder-decoder structure to embed a hidden representation for encoding and decoding variable length inputs and outputs. We choose to use gated recurrent units (GRUs) over long short-term memory units (LSTMs) [15] since the former is found to be simpler yet yields no degraded performance [8]. Despite the promise inherent in RNNs, however, only a few works have applied RNNs to behavior prediction tasks. Multiple LSTMs are used in [3] to jointly predict human trajectories, but their model is limited to producing fixed-length trajectories, whereas our model can produce variable-length ones. A Fusion-RNN that combines information from sensory streams to anticipate a driver’s maneuver is proposed in [17], but again their model outputs deterministic and fixed-length predictions.\nDeep generative models Our work is also related to deep generative models [37, 35, 44], as we have a sample generation process that is built on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) [22] within the framework. Since our prediction model essentially performs posterior-based probabilistic inference where candidate samples are generated based on conditioning variables (i.e., past motions besides latent variables), we naturally extend our method to exploit a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) [21, 41] during the sample generation process. Dense trajectories of pixels are predicted from a single image using CVAE in [46], while we focus on predicting long-term behaviors of multiple interacting agents in dynamic scenes.\nUnlike our framework, all aforementioned approaches lack either consideration of scene context, modeling of interaction with other agents or capabilities in producing continuous, time-profiled and long-term accurate predictions."

The future trajectory of an agent i is defined as Yi = {yi,t+1, yi,t+2, .., yi,t+δ}, and the past trajectory is defined similarly as Xi = {xi,t−ι+1, xi,t−ι+2, .., xi,t}. Here, each element of a trajectory (e.g., yi,t) is a vector in R2 (or R3) representing the coordinates of agent i at time t, and δ and ι refer to the maximum length of time steps for future and past respectively. Since direct optimization of continuous and high dimensional Y is not feasible, we design our method to first sample a diverse set of future predictions and assign a probabilistic score to each of the samples to approximate P (Y|X, I). In this section, we describe the details of DESIRE (Fig. 2) in the following structure: Sample Generation Module (Sec. 3.1), Ranking and Refinement Module (Sec. 3.2), and Scene Context Fusion (Sec. 3.3)."

      "text" : "Future prediction can be inherently ambiguous and has uncertainties as multiple plausible scenarios can be explained under the same past situation (e.g., a vehicle heading toward an intersection can make different turns as seen in Fig. 1). Thus, learning a deterministic function f that directly maps {X, I} to Y will under-represent potential prediction space and easily over-fit to training data. Moreover, a naively trained network with a simple loss will produce predictions that average out all possible outcomes.\nIn order to tackle the uncertainty, we adopt a deep generative model, conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) [41], inside of DESIRE framework. CVAE is a generative model that can learn the distribution P (Yi|Xi) of\nthe output Yi conditioned on the input Xi by introducing a stochastic latent variable zi2. It is composed of multiple neural networks, such as recognition networkQφ(zi|Yi, Xi), (conditional) prior network Pν(zi|Xi), and generation network Pθ(Yi|Xi, zi). Here, θ, φ, ν denote the parameters of corresponding networks. The prior of the latent variables zi is modulated by the input Xi, however, this can be relaxed to make the latent variables statistically independent of input variables, i.e., Pν(zi|Xi) = Pν(zi) [21, 41]. Essentially, a CVAE introduces stochastic latent variables zi that are learned to encode a diverse set of predictions Yi given input Xi, making it suitable for modeling one-to-many mapping. During training, Qφ(zi|Yi, Xi) is learned such that it gives higher probability to zi that is likely to produce a reconstruction Ŷi close to actual prediction given the full context Xi and Yi. At test time zi is sampled randomly from the prior distribution and decoded through the decoder network to produce a prediction hypothesis. This enables probabilistic inference which serves to handle multi-modalities in the prediction space. Train phase: Firstly, the past and future trajectories of an agent i, Xi and Yi respectively, are encoded through two RNN encoders with separate set of parameters (i.e., RNN Encoder1 and RNN Encoder2 in Fig. 2). The resulting two encodings,HXi andHYi , are concatenated and passed through one fully connected (fc) layer with a non-linear activation (e.g., relu). Two side-by-side fc layers are followed to produce both the mean µzi and the standard deviation σzi over zi. The distribution of zi is modeled as a Gaussian distribution (i.e., zi ∼ Qφ(zi|Xi, Yi) = N (µzi , σzi)) and is regularized by theKL divergence against a prior distribution Pν(zi) := N (0, I) during the training. Upon successful training, the target distribution is learned in the latent vari-\n2Notice that we learn the distribution independently over different agents in this step. Interaction between agents is considered in Sec. 3.2.\nable zi, which allows one to draw a random sample zi from a Gaussian distribution to reconstruct Yi at test time. Since back-propagation is not possible through random sampling, we adopt the standard reparameterization trick [22] to make it differentiable.\nIn order to model Pθ(Yi|Xi, zi), zi is combined with Xi as follows. The sampled latent variable zi is passed to one fc layer to match the dimension ofHXi that is followed by a softmax layer, producing β(zi). Then that is combined with the encodings of past trajectoriesHXi through a masking operation (i.e., element-wise multiplication). One can interpret this as a guided drop out where the guidance β is derived from the full context of individual trajectory during the training phase, while it is randomly drawn from Xi, Yi agnostic prior distribution z(k)i ∼ Pν(zi) in the testing phase. Finally, the following RNN decoder (i.e., RNN Decoder1 in Fig. 2) takes the output of the previous step,HXi β(z (k) i ), and generates K number of future prediction samples, i.e., Ŷi (1) , Ŷi (2) , .., Ŷi (K) .\nThere are two loss terms in training the CVAE-based RNN encoder-decoder.\n• Reconstruction Loss: `Recon = 1K ∑ k ‖Yi − Ŷi (k) ‖. This\nloss measures how far the generated samples are from the actual ground truth. • KLD Loss: `KLD = DKL(Qφ(zi|Yi, Xi)‖Pν(zi)). This regularization loss measures how close the sampling distribution at test time is to the distribution of latent variable that we learn during training.\nTest phase: At test time, the encodings of future trajectories HYi are not available, thus the encodings of past trajectories HXi are combined with multiple random samples of latent variable z(k)i drawn from the prior z (k) i ∼ Pν(zi). Similar to the training phase,HXi β(z (k) i ) is passed to the following\nRNN decoder (i.e., RNN Decoder1 in Fig. 2) to generate a diverse set of prediction hypotheses. Further details: For both train and test phases, we pass trajectories through a temporal convolution layer before encoding to encourage the network to learn the concept of velocity from adjacent frames before getting passed into RNN encoders. Also, RNNs are implemented using gated recurrent units (GRU) [7] to learn long-term dependencies, yet they can be easily replaced with other popular RNNs like long short-term memory units (LSTM) [15]. In summary, this sample generation module produces a set of diverse hypotheses critical to capturing the multimodality of the prediction task, through a effective combination of CVAE and RNN encoder-decoder. Unlike [46], where CVAE is used to predict for short-term visual motion from a single image, our CVAE module generates diverse set of future trajectories based on a past trajectory."

      "text" : "Predicting a distant future can be far more challenging than predicting one close by. In order to tackle this, we adopt the concept of decision-making process in reinforcement learning (RL) where an agent is trained to choose its actions that maximizes long-term rewards to achieve its goal [43]. Instead of designing a reward function manually, however, IOC [50, 11] learns an unknown reward function. Inspired by this, we design an RNN model that assigns rewards to each prediction hypothesis Ŷi (k)\nand measures their goodness s(k)i based on the accumulated long-term rewards. Thereafter, we also directly refine prediction hypotheses by learning displacements4Ŷi (k)\nto the actual prediction through another fc layer. Lastly, the module receives iterative feedbacks from regressed predictions and keeps adjusting so that it produces precise predictions at the end. The model is illustrated in the right side of Fig. 2. During the process, we combine 1) past motion history through the embedding vectorHX, 2) semantic scene context through a CNN with parameters ρ, and 3) interaction among multiple agents by using interaction features (Sec. 3.3). Notice that unlike typical robotics applications [50, 11], we do not assume that the goal (final destination) is known or the dynamics of the agents are given. Our model learns the agents dynamics as well as the scene context in a coherent framework. Learning to score: For an agent i, there are K number of samples (i.e., Ŷ (1)i , Ŷ (2) i , .., Ŷ (K) i ) that are generated by our CVAE sampler. Let the score s of individual prediction hypothesis Ŷ (k)i for the agent i be defined as follows,\ns(Ŷ (k) i ; I,X, Ŷ (∀) j\\i) = T∑ t=1 ψ(ŷ (k) i,t ; I,X, Ŷ (∀) τ<t), (1)\nwhere Ŷ(∀)j\\i is the prediction samples of other agents (i.e., ∀j, where j 6= i), ŷ(k)i,t is the kth prediction sample of an\nagent i at time t, Ŷ(∀)τ<t is all the prediction samples until a time-step t, T is the maximum prediction length, and ψ is the reward function that assigns a reward value at each time-step. ψ is implemented as an fc layer that is connected to the hidden vector of RNN cell at each time step. We share the parameters of the fc layer over all the time steps (each RNN cell outputs the hidden state of the same dimension). Therefore, the score s is accumulated rewards over time, accounting for the entire future rewards being assigned to each hypothesis. This enables our model to make a strategic decision by allowing us to rank samples as in other samplingbased IOC frameworks [11]. In addition, the reward function ψ incorporates both scene context I as well as the interaction between agents (see Sec. 3.3). Learning to refine: Alongside the scores, our model also estimates a regression vector4Ŷ (k)i that refines each prediction sample Ŷ (k)i . The regression vector for each agent i is obtained with the regression function η defined as follows,\n4Ŷ (k)i = η(Ŷ (k) i ; I,X, Ŷ (∀) j\\i). (2)\nRepresented as parameters of a neural network, the regression function η accumulates both scene contexts and all other agents dynamics from the past to entire future frames, and estimates the best displacement vector 4Ŷ (k)i over entire time-horizon T . Similarly to the score s, it accounts for what happens in the future both in terms of scene context and interactions among dynamic agents to produce the output. We implement η as another fc layer that is connected to the last hidden vector of the RNN which outputsM×T dimensional vector. M = 2 (or 3) is the dimension of the location state. Iterative feedback: Using the displacement vector4Ŷ (k)i , we iteratively refine the prediction hypothesis Ŷ (k)i . After each cycle, Ŷ (k)i is updated by Ŷ (k) i +4Ŷ (k) i , and fed into the IOC module. This process is similar to the gradient descent optimization of Ŷi over the score function s, but it does not require to compute the gradient over RNN which can be very unstable due to the recurrent structure (i.e., vanishing or exploding gradient). We observe that iterative refinement indeed improves the quality of prediction samples in the experiments (see Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Losses: There are two loss terms in training the IOC ranking and refinement module. • Cross-entropy Loss: `CE = H(p, q) of which the tar-\nget distribution q is obtained by softmax(−d(Yi, Ŷ (k)i )), where d(Yi, Ŷ (k) i ) = max ‖Ŷ (k) i − Yi‖.\n• Regression Loss: `Reg = 1K ∑ k ‖Yi − Ŷi (k) −4Ŷi (k) ‖\nFinally, the total loss of the entire network is defined as a multi-task loss as follows, where N is the number of agents in one batch.\n`Total = 1\nN ∑ i∈N `Recon + `KLD + `CE + `Reg (3)"

Thus, it is important that the RNN must contain the information about 1) individual past motion context, 2) semantic scene context and 3) the interaction between multiple agents, in order to provide proper hidden representations that can score and refine a prediction Ŷ (k)i .\nWe achieve the goal by having an RNN that takes following input xt at each time step:\nxt = [ γ(v̂i,t), p(ŷi,t; ρ(I)), r(ŷi,t; ŷj\\i,t,hŶj\\i) ] (4)\nwhere v̂i,t is a velocity of Ŷ (k) i at t, γ is a fc layer with a ReLU activation that maps the velocity to a high dimensional representation space, p(ŷi,t; ρ(I)) is a pooling operation that pools the CNN feature ρ(I) at the location ŷi,t, r(ŷi,t; ŷj\\i,t,hŶj\\i) is the interaction feature computed by a fusion layer that spatially aggregates other agents hidden vectors, similar to SocialPooling (SP) layer [3]. The embedding vectorHXi (the output of the RNN Encoder1 in Fig. 2) is shared as the initial hidden state of the RNN, in order to provide the individual past motion context. We share this embedding with the CVAE module since both require the same information to be embedded in the vector. Interaction Feature: We implement a spatial grid based pooling layer similar to SP layer [3]. For each sample k of an agent i at t, we define spatial grid cells centered at ŷ(k)i,t . Over each grid cell g, we pool the hidden representation of all the other agents’ samples that are within the spatial cell, ∀j 6= i,∀k, ŷ(k)j,t ∈ g. Instead of using the max pooling operation with rectangular grids, we adopt log-polar grids with an average pooling. Combined with CNN features, the SCF module provides the RNN decoder with both static and dynamic scene information. It learns consistency between semantics of agents and scenes for reliable prediction."

Baselines: RNN ED performs significantly better than Linear since it can learn non-linear motion. We observe that RNN ED-SI performs worse than RNN ED on the KITTI since the model learns to behave reactive (see Fig. 6). This might be due to the small size of the dataset, which makes it hard to learn predictive CNN/interaction features (i.e., features need to have high capacity to encode long-term information). On the contrary, RNN ED-SI significantly outperforms RNN ED on SDD dataset since SDD is much bigger and has a large number of interactions among agents.

However, we observe clear improvement on the SDD dataset since there are rich set of scenes with interactions between agents. Although our model with top 1 sample (DESIRE Best) achieves higher error compared to the direct regression baselines, using a few more samples yields much better prediction accuracy (i.e., DESIRE 10%). Note that direct regression models with lower error are not necessarily better if averaging various futures (e.g., going straight). We believe that in some applications, probabilistic prediction over a variety of outcomes is more desirable than a single MAP prediction. For both datasets, DESIRE achieves error on par with best baselines using as little as top 2 samples of DESIRE-SI-IT4 predictions (see Fig. 4). Qualitative results are presented in Fig. 6 and in the supplementary material.\nAblative study: We conduct further experiments for varying K and past length to supplement the main experiments and report the results in Table 2 and Table 3."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion",
      "text" : "We introduce a novel framework DESIRE for distant future prediction of multiple agents in complex scene. The model incorporates both static and dynamic scene contexts with a deep IOC framework and produces stochastic, continuous, and time-profiled long-term predictions that can effectively account for the uncertainty in the future prediction task. Our empirical evaluations on driving and surveillance scenarios demonstrate clear improvement over other baselines. For future work, we believe that our model can be further improved on larger datasets and be applied to various robotics applications with a direct use of perspective images."

DESIRE effectively predicts future locations of objects in multiple scenes by 1) accounting for the multi-modal nature of the future prediction (i.e., given the same context, future may vary), 2) foreseeing the potential future outcomes and make a strategic prediction based on that, and 3) reasoning not only from the past motion history, but also from the scene context as well as the interactions among the agents. DESIRE achieves these in a single end-to-end trainable neural network model, while being computationally efficient. The model first obtains a diverse set of hypothetical future prediction samples employing a conditional variational autoencoder, which are ranked and refined by the following RNN scoring-regression module. Samples are scored by accounting for accumulated future rewards, which enables better long-term strategic decisions similar to IOC frameworks. An RNN scene context fusion module jointly captures past motion histories, the semantic scene context and interactions among multiple agents. A feedback mechanism iterates over the ranking and refinement to further boost the prediction accuracy. We evaluate our model on two publicly available datasets: KITTI and Stanford Drone Dataset. Our experiments show that the proposed model significantly improves the prediction accuracy compared to other baseline methods.",
