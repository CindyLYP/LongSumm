{"1006": "in this paper, we outline an approach to detecting such egregious conversations, using behavioral cues from the user, patterns in agent responses, and useragent interaction. using logs of two commercial systems, we show that using these features improves the detection f1-score by around over using textual features alone. in addition, we show that those features are common across two quite different domains and , arguably, universal. the goal of this work is to reliably detect egregious conversations between a human and a virtual agent. we treat this as a binary classification task, where the target classes are egregious and nonegregious. while we are currently applying this to complete conversations, some of the features examined here could likely be used to detect egregious conversations as they were unfolding in real time. to perform detection of egregious conversation, features from both customer inputs and agent responses are extracted, together with features related to the combination of specific inputs and responses. in addition, some of these are contextual, meaning that they are dependent on where in the conversation they appear. using this set of features for detecting egregious conversations is novel, and as our experimental results show, improves performance compared to a model based solely on features extracted from the conversation s text. this paper proposes a novel approach to address the question of whether or not a virtual agent can reliably detect the intent of each customer . as typically implemented , the virtual agent is trained to reliably detect the intent of each customer s utterance meaningfully. accurate intent detection is thus a fundamental characteristic of well-trained virtual agents, and incorrect intent analysis is reported as the leading cause of user dissatisfaction ( sarikaya , 2017 ) . however, since svm, neural network, etc., is often used to detect intents, its probabilistic behavior can cause the agent to repeat the same or semantically similar response over and over again, despite the user s same attempt to rephrase intent. such agent repetitions lead to an unnatural interaction ( kluwer, 2011) . to identify the agent s agent s similarity, we used the positive sentiment score ( neg emo) as a filter for other customer features, such as high positive emotions capture different styles of the agent, or indicate that the customer is somewhat satisfied ( rychalski and hudson, 2017 ) . in this paper, we propose a classification model that is based on a similarity analysis. the similarity analysis is based on the similarity between the agent s response and the customer s turn. in this case, a pair may contain a turn in which the customer expressed negative power judgements and received a response of not trained by the agent. in this case, we would leverage the two analyses: a low score may indicate a poor interaction, which might lead to the agent becoming egregious. thus, a low score may indicate a poor interaction, which might lead to the agent becoming egregious. we trained a binary svm with a linear kernel . a feature vector for a sample in the training data is generated using the scores calculated for the described features, where each feature value is a number between 0,1. after the model was trained, after being transformed to a feature vector in the same way a training sample is transformed. this process generated the egregious class sizes of ( 8.6) and ( 8.6) and have experience in designing conversational agents systems. this paper proposes an egr model for the classification task. the egr model is compared to a text-based model in terms of accuracy and recall. the goal of this work is to give developers of automated agents tools to detect and then solve problems cre- ated by exceptionally bad conversations. in this context, future work includes collecting more data and using neural approaches (e.g., rnn, cnn) for analysis, validating our models on a range of domains beyond the two explored here. the goal of this paper is to detect egregious conversations in customer care systems. an ineffective interaction requires the expenditure of relatively effort from the user with little return on the investment these efforts can appear as behavioral cues in the large customer inputs and include emotions, repetitions, and more. in examining the conversation logs, we noticed that it is not unusual to find a customer asking to be transferred to a human agent. such a request might indicate that the virtual agent is not providing a satisfactory service. moreover, even if there are human agents, they might not be available at all times, and thus, a rejection of such a request is sometimes reasonable, but might still lead to customer frustration. in order to analyze the emotions that customers exhibit in each turn, we utilized the ibm tone analyzer service, the available publicly online7 . in order to analyze the emotions that customers exhibit in each turn, we infer emotions such as frustration, sadness, anger, etc. in order to analyze the emotions that customers exhibit in each turn, we focused on negative emotions ( neg emo) to identify turns with a negative emotional peak ( i.e., single utterances that carried high negative emotional state, as well as to estimate the aggregated negative emotion intensity throughout the conversation. the goal of this paper is to show how it is possible to detect egregious conversations (i.e., conversations that are extraordinarily bad in some way, those conversations which are extraordinarily bad in some way, those conversations which are too short to be meaningful since the customer never replied or provided more details about the issue at hand). as explained, the goal of this paper were difficult in this context, future work includes collecting more data and using neural approaches for analysis, validating cnn. in this context, future work includes collecting more data and using neural approaches for analysis, validating cnn.", "1000": "###", "1001": "###", "1002": "###", "1003": "###", "1004": "###", "1005": "###", "1007": "###", "1008": "###",
